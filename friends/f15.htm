<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> Mrs. Tedlock. You're looking lovely today. And may I say, that is a <b>very</b> flattering sleeve length on you.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Mrs. Tedlock:</b> Yes. Well, Mr. Kostelick wants you to stop by his office at the end of the day.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, listen. If this is about those prank memos, I had nothing to do with them. Really. Nothing at all. Really. (Chandler tries to hide a rubber chicken from the woman.) And frankly, I don't think those kind of shenanigans have any place in an office environment.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">[Scene: Central Perk, everyone is there but Chandler. Phoebe runs in, excitedly.]</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> What's going on?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>All:</b> What is it?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> So, it's a typical day at work. I'm inputting my numbers, and big Al calls me into his office and tells me he wants to make me processing supervisor.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>All:</b> That's great!</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> So.... I quit.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>All:</b> Why?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> Why? This was supposed to be a temp job!</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> Yeah, Chandler... you've been there for five years.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> If I took this promotion, it'd be like admitting that this is what I actually do.</font></p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh man... Does that mean we have to start buying our own toilet paper?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> That was Joey Tribbiani with the big picture, Dan?</p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> So was it a lot more money?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> It doesn't matter. I just don't want to be one of those guys that's in his office until twelve o'clock at night worrying about the WENUS.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">(Everyone looks at him, confused.)</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> ... the WENUS?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> I don't know. That's the thing. I don't know what I want to do. I just know I'm not going to figure it out working there.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Phoebe:</b> Hi! (turns back to Chandler, then to Monica) Oh, yeah, no, I know. You're a chef. I know, and I thought of you first, but um, Chandler's the one who needs a job right now, so....</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah... I just don't have that much cheffing experience. Unless it's an all-toast restaurant.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Phoebe:</b> (to Monica's tapping) Yeah, yeah! </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><strong>Monica:</strong> Well, what kind of food is he looking for?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, he wants to do some ecclectic, so he's looking for someone who can, you know, create the entire menu.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> (excited) Oh my God!</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, I know! (turns to Chandler) So, what do you think?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> Thanks, Phoebe. But I just don't really see myself in a big white hat.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Phoebe:</b> OK. (pause) Oh Monica! Guess what!</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> Can you see my nipples through this shirt?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> No. But don't worry, I'm sure they're still there.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Phoebe:</b> Where are you going, Mr. Suity-Man?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> Well, I have an appointment to see Dr. Robert Pillman, career counselor a-gogo. (pause) I added the "a-gogo."</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> Career counselor?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> Hey, you guys all know what you want to do.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> I don't!</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> Hey, you guys <b>in the living room</b> all know what you want to do. You know, you have goals. You have dreams. I don't have a dream.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> Ah, the lesser-known "I don't have a dream" speech.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">(Monica enters, excited.)</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> Oh, I love my life, I love my life!</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Phoebe:</b> Ooh! <em>Brian's Song</em>!</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> The meeting with the guy went great?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> So great! He showed me where the restaurant's going to be. It's this, it's this cute little place on 10th Street. Not too big, not too small. Just right.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> Was it formerly owned by a blonde woman and some bears?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> So anyway, I'm cooking dinner for him Monday night. You know, kind of like an audition. And Phoebe, he really wants you to be here, which will be great for me because then you can 'ooh' and 'ahh' and make yummy noises.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> What are you going to make?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Phoebe:</b> (as though Rachel wasn't paying attention) Yummy noises.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> (pause) And Monica, what are <b>you</b> going to make?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> I don't know. I don't know. It's just going to be so great!</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Phoebe:</b> Ooh! I know what you could make! (runs over to join Monica and Rachel in the kitchen) I know! Oh, you should definitely make that thing... you know, with the stuff? (Monica doesn't know.) You know, that thing... with the stuff...? OK, I don't know.  (sits down)</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> Hey guys, does anybody know a good date place in the neighborhood?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Joey:</b> How about Tony's? If you can finish a 32-ounce steak, it's free.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> OK, ahem, hey, does anybody know a good place if you're not dating a puma?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> Who are you going out with?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, is this the bug lady?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> (trying to sound like a bug) Bzzzz.... I love you, Ross.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> Her name is Celia. She's not a bug lady. She's curator of insects at the museum.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> So what are you guys going to do?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> Oh, I just thought we could go out to dinner, and then maybe bring her back to my place and I'd introduce her to my monkey.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> And he's <b>not</b> speaking metaphorically.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Joey:</b> (aside to Ross) So.... back to your place...you thinking, maybe... (gestures with hands, back and forth) huh-huh?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> Well, I don't know.... (gestures) huh-huh.... but I'm hoping (gestures) huh-huh.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Joey:</b> I'm telling you, that monkey is a chick magnet! She's going to take one look at his furry, cute little face and it'll seal the deal.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">[Scene: Ross's apartment, Marcel is hanging from Celia's hair, and she is screaming, trying to get him off.]</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Joey:</b> (tasting) Mmmm. Good.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> Is it better than the other salmon mousse?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Joey:</b> It's creamier.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> Yeah, well, is that <b>better</b>?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Joey:</b> I don't know. We're talking about whipped fish, Monica. I'm just happy I'm keeping it down, y'know?</font></p>

<p><font size="3">(Chandler kicks the door closed, angrily. His clothes are askew, he looks beat.)</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> My God! What happened to you?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> Eight and a half hours of aptitude tests, intelligence tests, personality tests... and what do I learn? (he taps the results and reads them) "You are ideally suited for a career in data processing for a large multinational corporation."</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Phoebe:</b> That's so great! 'Cause you already know how to do that!</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> Can you believe it? I mean, don't I seem like somebody who should be doing something really <b>cool</b>? You know, I just always pictured myself doing something...something.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> (comes up and rubs him on the chest) Oh Chandler, I know, I know... oh, hey! You can see your nipples through this shirt!</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> (brings a plate of tiny appetizers over) Here you go, maybe this'll cheer you up.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> Ooh, you know, I had a grape about five hours ago, so I'd better split this with you.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> It's supposed to be that small. It's a pre-appetizer. The French call it an <em>amouz-bouche.</em> </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> (tastes it) Well.... it is amouz-ing...</font></p>

<p><font size="3">(Phone rings. Monica answers it.)</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Phoebe:</b> Ten dollars an hour for what?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> Oh, I asked one of the waitresses at work if she'd help me out.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> But, but?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> But, you see, it's just... this night has to go just perfect, you know? And, well, Wendy's more of a... professional waitress.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> Oh! I see. And I've sort of been maintaining my amateur status so that I can waitress in the Olympics.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> You know, I don't mean to brag, but I waited tables at Innsbruck in '76. Took home a bronze. (dead silence) <em>Amouz-bouche</em>? (holds out tray)</font></p>

I need something that's more than a job. I need something I can really care about... (Listens) And that's on top of the yearly bonus structure you mentioned earlier? (Listens) Look, Al, Al...

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> Oh, thank you. Would you like a tour?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Steve:</b> I was just being polite, but, alright. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">(They leave on the tour and Rachel goes to follow them but Phoebe stops her and drags her into the kitchen.)</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> What's up?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Phoebe:</b> (whispers) In the cab, on the way over, Steve blazed up a doobie.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> What?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Phoebe:</b> Smoked a joint? You know, lit a bone? Weed? Hemp? Ganja?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> OK, OK. I'm with you, Cheech. OK. Do you think he's gonna be cool...</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Steve:</b> (from the living room) Is it dry in here? (licks his lips)</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> Let me, let me get you some wine!</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> Yeah, I think we're ready for our first course. (Steve sits, Monica brings over a tray) OK, um, these are rot-shrimp ravioli, and celantro pondou sauce... (Steve starts to eat them one by one, quickly)... with just a touch of mints... and... (he finishes)... ginger.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Steve:</b> Well, smack my ass and call me Judy! These are fantastic!</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> Oh gosh, I'm so glad you liked them!</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Steve:</b> Like 'em? I could eat a hundred of them!</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> Oh, well... um, that's all there are of these. But in about eight and a half minutes, we'll be serving some delicious onion tartlets.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Steve:</b> Tartlets. Tartlets. Tartlets. The word has lost all meaning. (he gets up and goes into the kitchen)</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> Excuse me? Can I help you with anything?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Steve:</b> You know, I don't know what I'm looking for. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">(Rachel tries to get Monica's attention to tell her Steve is stoned. She pretends to drag on a joint, and Monica thinks she's giving her the 'OK' signal. Then Rachel does it again, inhaling deeply this time. Monica waves it off as though she doesn't believe it.)</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Steve:</b> (from kitchen) Ah, cool! Taco shells! (Rachel motions, "You see!") You know, these are... they're like a little corn envelope.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> (joining him and taking the taco shells) You know that? You don't want to spoil your appetite.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Steve:</b> (looking in cabinets) Hey! Sugar-O's! (grabs the cereal box)</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> You know, if you just wait another... six and a half minutes...</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Steve:</b> Macaroni and cheese! We gotta make this!</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> No, we don't. (reaches for box) </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Steve:</b> Oh, OK. (he drops the box on the floor) Oh, sorry. (When she bends down to pick it up he grabs a package of Gummi-bears from the cabinet.) </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> Why don't you just have a seat here? (he sits at the table, then tries to secretly eat the Gummi-bears. Monica spots him.) OK... give me the Gummi-bears.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Steve:</b> (childishly) No.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> Give them to me.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Steve:</b> Alright, we'll share.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> No, give me the...</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Steve:</b> Well then you can't have any. (she grabs for the package, and it breaks open. Gummi-bears fly everywhere, some into the punch bowl on the table.) Bear overboard! I think they're drowning. Don't just stand there, call 911! (he throws some Sugar-O's into the punch bowl) Hey fellows! Grab on a Sugar-O... save yourself! (Mimicking the bears) "Help!&nbsp; I'm drowning! &nbsp; Help!"</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> (furious) That's it! Dinner is over!</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Steve:</b> What?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> <b>What?</b></font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Steve:</b> Why?</font></p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What if I came into your office and I started... I can't think of an example, OK?</p>
 
<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b>It's just that I've waited seven years for an opportunity like this, and you can't even wait four and a half minutes for a stupid onion tartlet?</font></p>

<p><font size="3">(The oven goes off.)</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Steve:</b> (excited) Hey!</font></p>

<p><font size="3">[Scene: Central Perk, all are there except Chandler.]</font></p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> So I told him I'm sorry, it's just how I feel. And he told me I harshed his buzz. And I said, don't eat that, it's a kitchen magnet. And he didn't listen, so we left him in the emergency room.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Mon, I'm sorry.</p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Joey:</b> What a tool!</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> You did the right thing. You don't want to work for a guy like that.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><strong>Ross:</strong> Yeah!</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> I know... it's just... I thought this was, you know... it.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> Look, you'll get there. You're an amazing chef.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah! You know all those yummy noises? I wasn't faking.</font></p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, by the way, am I gonna get paid for the full three hours? Just a question, we'll talk about it later.</p>

<p><font size="3">(Ross gets up and goes over to the counter and Joey follows him.)</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Joey:</b> (to Ross) So, er... how did it go with Celia?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> Oh, I was unbelievable.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Joey:</b> All right, Ross!</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> I was the James Michener of dirty talk. It was the most elaborate filth you have <b>ever</b> heard. I mean, there were characters, plot lines, themes, a motif... at one point there were villagers.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Joey:</b> Whoa! And the... (gestures with hands) huh-huh?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> Well, ahem... you know, by the time we'd finished with all the dirty talk, it was kinda late... and we were both kind of exhausted, so uh...</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Joey:</b> You cuddled.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, which was nice.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Phoebe:</b> You guys wanna try and catch a late movie or something?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> Maybe, but shouldn't we wait for Chandler?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, where the hell is he?</font></p>

<p><font size="3">[Scene: Chandler's office, he's on the phone, agitated.]</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> (on phone) Yes, Fran. I know what time it is, but I'm looking at the WENUS and I'm not happy!... (Listens) Oh, really, really, really? Well, let me tell you something... you will care about it, because I care about it! You got it? Good! (slams phone down, then leans back and realizes what just happened) Whooooaaaa....</font></p>
