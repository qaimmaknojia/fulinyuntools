</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah right.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> It is. Eventually, it kind of... burns out. But hopefully, what you're
left with is trust, and security, and... well, in the case of my ex-wife, lesbianism. So,
you know, for all of those people who miss out on that passion... thing, there's all that
other good stuff.</font></p>
