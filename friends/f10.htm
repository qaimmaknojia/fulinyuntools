<p><b>All:</b> Oh!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> And look, Ugly Naked Guy is hanging candy canes.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Where?.. Oh, well. That's festive.</p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> Guys? There's a somebody I'd like you to meet. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">(A monkey jumps on to his shoulder.)</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>All:</b> Oooh!</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> W-wait. What is that?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> 'That' would be Marcel. You wanna say hi?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> No, no, I don't.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, he is precious! Where did you get him?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> My friend Bethel rescued him from some lab.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Phoebe:</b> That is so cruel! Why? Why would a parent name their child Bethel?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> Hey, that monkey's got a Ross on its ass!</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> Ross, is he gonna live with you, like, in your apartment?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> Yeah. I mean, it's been kinda quiet since Carol left, so...</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> Why don't you just get a roommate?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> Nah, I dunno... I think you reach a certain age, having a roommate is
kinda pathe- (Realises) ....sorry, that's, that's 'pathet', which is Sanskrit for 'really
cool way to live'.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">[Scene: Central Perk, Phoebe is getting ready to sing. Joey is not there.]</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Phoebe:</b> So you guys, I'm doing all new material tonight. I have twelve new songs
about my mother's suicide, and one about a snowman.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> Might wanna open with the snowman.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">(Enter Joey)</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b><b>All:</b></b> Hey, Joey. Hey, buddy.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> So, how'd it go?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Joey:</b> Ahhhhhh, I didn't get the job.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> How could you not get it? You were Santa last year.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Joey:</b> I dunno. Some fat guy's sleeping with the store manager. He's not even
jolly, it's all political.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> So what are you gonna be?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Joey:</b> Ah, I'm gonna be one of his helpers. It's just such a slap in the face,
y'know?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> Hey, do you guys know what you're doing for New Year's? (They all
protest and hit her with cushions) Gee, what?! What is wrong with New Year's?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> Nothing for you, you have Paolo. You don't have to face the horrible
pressures of this holiday: desperate scramble to find anything with lips just so you can
have someone to kiss when the ball drops!! Man, I'm talking loud!</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> Well, for your information, Paolo is gonna be in Rome this New Year, so
I'll be just as pathetic as the rest of you. </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, you wish!</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> I've got an idea -- dinner</font></p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> It's perfect. We'll put it between lunch and breakfast.</p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> It's just that I'm sick of being a victim of this Dick Clark holiday.
I say this year, no dates, we make a pact. Just the six of us- dinner.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b><b>All:</b></b> Yeah, okay. Alright.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> Y'know, I was hoping for a little more enthusiasm. </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b><b>All:</b></b> Woooo! Yeah!</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> Phoebe, you're on.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, oh, good.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> (Into microphone) Okay, hi. Ladies and gentlemen, back by popular
demand, Miss Phoebe Buffay. Wooh!</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Phoebe:</b> (Takes mike) Hi! Thanks, hi. Um, I wanna start with a song that means a lot
to me this time of year. (Shakes bell as an introduction) (Sung:) </font></p>

<blockquote>
<font size="3">  </font><p><font size="3"><em>I made a man with eyes of coal<br>
  And a smile so bewitchin',<br>
  How was I supposed to know<br>
  That my mom was dead in the kitchen?</em><br>

  Are resting in a little yellow jar,<br>
  And sometimes when it's breezy...</em></font></p>

<p><font size="3">(Over the sound of Phoebe singing we hear two scientists, Max and David, having a noisy
discussion)</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Excuse me, excuse me! Yeah, noisy boys! (They stop talking and look up) Is
it something that you would like to share with the entire group?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Max:</b> No. No, that's- that's okay.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, c'mon, if it's important enough to discuss while I'm playing, then
I assume it's important enough for everyone else to hear!</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> (Quietly, to the others) That guy's going home with a note!</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>David:</b> Noth- I was- I was just saying to my-</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Phoebe:</b> Could you speak up please?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>David:</b> (Stands up and speaks more loudly) Sorry, I wa- I was just saying to my
friend that I thought you were the most beautiful woman that I'd ever seen in my- in my
life. And then he said that- you said you thought</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Max:</b> Daryl Hannah.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>David:</b> Daryl Hannah was the most beautiful woman that he'd ever seen in his life
and I said yeah, I liked her in Splash, a lot, but not so much in- in Wall Street, I
thought she had kind of a </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Max:</b> Hard quality.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>David:</b> -hard quality. And uh, while Daryl Hannah is beautiful in a conventional
way, you are luminous with a kind of a delicate grace. Then, uh, that-that-that's when you
started yelling. (Sits down)</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay, we're gonna take a short break. (Goes over to their table)</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Joey:</b> Hey, that guy's going home with more than a note!</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> OK, Marcel. Sit here. (Marcel wanders off)</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> Pheebs, I can't believe he hasn't kissed you yet. I mean God, by my
sixth date with Paolo, I mean he had already named both my breasts! ...Ooh. Did I just
share too much?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> Just a smidge.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Phoebe:</b> David's like, y'know, Scientist Guy. He's very methodical.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> I think it's romantic.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Phoebe:</b> Me too! Oh! Did you ever see An Officer and a Gentleman?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah!</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, he's kinda like the guy I went to see that with. Except, except
he-he's smarter, and gentler, and sweeter... I just- I just wanna be with him all the
time. Y'know, day and night, and night and day... and special occasions... </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> Wait a minute, wait a minute, I see where this is going, you're gonna
ask him to New Year's, aren't you. You're gonna break the pact. She's gonna break the
pact.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Phoebe:</b> No, no, no, no, no, no. Yeah, could I just?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, 'cause I already asked Janice.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> What?!</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> C'mon, this was a pact! This was your pact! </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> I snapped, okay? I couldn't handle the pressure and I snapped.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> Yeah, but Janice? That-that was like the worst breakup in history!</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> I'm not saying it was a good idea, I'm saying I snapped!</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> Okay, look, he's not gonna hurt them, right?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> Do you always have to bring him here?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> I didn't wanna leave him alone. Alright? We- we had our first fight this
morning. I think it has to do with my working late. I said some things that I didn't mean,
and he- he threw some faeces...</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> Y'know, if you're gonna work late, I could look in on him for you.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> Oh, that'd be great! Okay, but if you do, make sure it seems like you're
there to see him, okay, and you're not like doing it as a favour to me.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, but if he asks, I'm not going to lie.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">[Scene: Max and David's lab, David is explaining something to Phoebe with the aid of a

<p><font size="3"><b>David:</b> ...But, you can't actually test this theory, because today's particle
accelerators are nowhere near powerful enough to simulate these conditions.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay, alright, I have a question, then. </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>David:</b> Yuh.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Phoebe:</b> Um, were you planning on kissing me ever?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>David:</b> Uh, that's definitely a, uh, valid question. And, uh, the answer would be
(Writes YES on the board) yes. Yes I was. But, see, I wanted it to be this phenomenal kiss
that happened at this phenomenal moment, because, well, 'cause it's you.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Phoebe:</b> Sure.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>David:</b> Right. But, see, the longer I waited, the more phenomenal the kiss had to
be, and now we've reached a place where it's just gotta be one of those things where I
just like... sweep everything off the table and throw you down on it. And, uh, I'm not
really a, uh, sweeping sorta fella.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, David, I, I think you are a sweeping sorta fella. I mean, you're a
sweeper! ...trapped inside a physicist's body.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>David:</b> Rrrreally.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, yeah, oh, I'm sure of it. You should just do it, just sweep and
throw me. </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>David:</b> ...Now? Now?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh yeah, right now, just..</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>David:</b> Okay, okay, okay. (Gets ready to sweep, and then picks up a laptop
computer) Y'know what, this was just really expensive. (Puts it down elsewhere. Then picks
up a microscope) And I'll take- this was a gift. (Moves it)</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay, now you're just kinda tidying up. </font></p>

desk and grabs Phoebe) You want me to actually throw you or you-you wanna just hop?</font></p>

somebody- I thought I'd ask Fun Bobby.</font></p>

do?</font></p>

drops?</font></p>

around all the time dragging his hands... </font></p>

hair! So I'm blowing my attack whistle thingy and three more cabs show up, and as I'm
going to get into a cab she tackles me. And I hit my head on the kerb and cut my lip on my

<p><b>Monica:</b> Let me get it for you.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> OwOwOwOwOw...</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> OK. You know what? It looks fine.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> OK, here we go. Screw Paolo, screw the psycho cab lady. It's New Year's Eve. Let's have a good time.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> OK, here we go.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> OK, there you go, this way. Here you go.</p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Sandy:</b> Y'know, when I saw you at the store last week, it was probably the first
time I ever mentally undressed an elf.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Joey:</b> Wow, that's, uh, dirty.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Sandy:</b> Yeah.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Joey:</b> Hey, kids...</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> (Watching Marcel play with Phoebe. To Chandler) Look at him. I'm not
saying he has to spend the whole evening with me, but at least check in.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Janice:</b> (Startles them) There you are! Haaah, you got away from me!</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> (Imitating) But you found me!</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Janice:</b> Here, Ross, take our picture. (Hands him a camera and he starts
snapping) Smile! You're on Janice Camera! HAHAHAHAHA...</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> Kill me. Kill me now. </font></p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hi, I'm Rachel. So whose friend are you? Oh, look at me, spilling everywhere.</p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> Hey everybody! It's Fun Bobby!</font></p>

<p><font size="3">(Everyone cheers. Monica opens the door. Bobby is obviously very depressed)</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Fun Bobby:</b> Hey, sorry I'm late. But my, uh, grandfather, he- died about two
hours ago. But I-I-I couldn't get a flight out 'til tomorrow, so here I am!</font></p>

him again.</font></p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Um, Bobby? Fun Bobby? Lemme talk to you for just a second. Look uh, I recently lost a grandparent myself so I really know exactly how you feel. But uh, you're really bringing the party down.</p>

<p><b>Bobby:</b> I'm sorry..</p> 

<p><b>Monica:</b> OK, yeah, okay. There you go. There you go.</p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Janice:</b> (Ross is still taking their photo) Oh, I'm gonna blow this one up, and
I'm gonna write 'Reunited' in glitter.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> Alright, Janice, that's it! Janice... Janice... Hey, Janice, when I
invited you to this party I didn't necessarily think that it meant that we-</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Janice:</b> Oh, no. Oh, no.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> I'm sorry you misunderstood...</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Janice:</b> Oh my God. You listen to me, Chandler, you listen to me. One of these
times is just gonna be your last chance with me. (She runs off)</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>David:</b> No, I'm... not going to Minsk.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, you are so going to Minsk. You belong in Minsk. You can't stay here
just 'cause of me.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>David:</b> Yes I can. Because if I go it means I have to break up with you, and I
can't break up with you.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh yes, yes, yes you can. Just say, um, 'Phoebe, I love you, but my work is my life and
that's what I have to do right now'. And I say 'your work?! Your work?! How can you say
that?!'. And then you say, um, 'it's tearing me apart, but I have no choice. Can't you
understand that?'. And I say (Hits him) 'no! No! I can't understand that!'.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>David:</b> Uh, ow.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Phoebe:</b> Ooh, sorry. Um, and, and then you put your arms around me. And then you
put your arms around me. (He does so) And, um, and then you tell me that you love me and
you'll never forget me.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>David:</b> I'll never forget you.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Phoebe:</b> And then you say that it's almost midnight and you have to go because
you don't wanna start the new year with me if you can't finish it. (They kiss) I'm gonna
miss you. You scientist guy.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> Ooh. Uh, I don't know how to tell you this, but she's in Monica's

except for the gang cheers and kisses)</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> Y'know, I uh.. just thought I'd throw this out here. I'm no math whiz,
but I do believe there are three girls and three guys right here. (Makes kiss noise)</font></p>
