<p><font size="3"><b>Phoebe:</b> Just wanna check my horoscope, see if it was right.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> Oh my God. (Grabs Phoebe and turns her away) Phoebe. Don't look now, but
behind us is a guy who has the potential to break our hearts and plunge us into a pit of
depression. </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> No it's mine. Why did I 'woo-hoo'? I mean, what was I hoping would happen? That-that
he'd turn round and say 'I love that sound, I must have you now'?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Phoebe:</b> I just wish there was something we could do. (Bends down and talks to
him) Hello. Hello, Coma Guy. GET UP, YOU GIRL SCOUT! UP! UP! UP!</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Phoebe:</b> Maybe nobody's tried this.</font></p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I wish we at least knew his name... </p>

sleeping, he looks smart.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, but the dents in his knuckles mean he's artistic.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> OK. He's a lawyer who teaches sculpting on the side. And he can dance!</p>

y'know, and not saying 'Yeah, I understand' but really wondering what you look like naked.</font></p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah the thing after the opera with the girl with the trick hip?</p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> C'mon, Chandler, I love your mom. I think she's a blast.</font></p>

What is that all about?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Phoebe:</b> Your mom was arrested?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> Shhh, busy beaming with pride.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Mrs. Bing:</b> (on TV) ...This is kind of embarrassing, but occasionally after I've
been intimate with a man...</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> Now why would she say that's embarrassing?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>All:</b> Shhh.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Mrs. Bing:</b> (on TV) ...I just get this craving for Kung Pow Chicken.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> THAT'S TOO MUCH INFORMATION!!</font></p>

<p><b>Nora Bing:</b> Needless to say, he got a huge tip.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, God, I love her!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I think I'm having a stroke.</p>

mom, somehow.. I don't mean that, I don't mean that bad...</font></p>

No, I mean it! I mean, when I read Euphoria at Midnight, all I wanted to do was become a
writer.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Mrs. Bing:</b> Oh, please, honey, listen, if I can do it, anybody can. You just

<p><font size="3"><b>Mrs. Bing:</b> No. Because I know how to write men that women fall in love with.
Believe me, I cannot sell a Paolo. People will not turn three hundred twenty-five pages
for a Paolo. C'mon, the guy's a secondary character, a, y'know, complication you
eventually kill off.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> When?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Mrs. Bing:</b> He's not a hero. ...You know who our hero is.</font></p>
