better than this?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Shelley:</b> Question. You're not dating anybody, are you, because I met somebody
who would be perfect for you.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> Ah, y'see, perfect might be a problem. Had you said 'co-dependent', or
'self-destructive'...</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> It's hard to enjoy a cup of noodles after that. I mean, is that
ridiculous? Can you believe she actually thought that?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> Um... yeah. Well, I mean, when I first met you, y'know, I thought maybe,
possibly, you might be... </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> You did?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, but then you spent Phoebe's entire birthday party talking to my
breasts, so then I figured maybe not.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> Huh. Did, uh... any of the rest of you guys think that when you first
met me?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> No. No, it's just 'cause, uh, I kinda wanted to go out with her too, so I
told her, actually, you were seeing Bernie Spellman... who also liked her, so...</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> Okay, I-I d'know, you-you just- you have a quality.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>All:</b> Yes. Absolutely. A quality.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, oh, a quality, good, because I was worried you guys were gonna be
vague about this.</font></p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Y'know Chandler, I think this is gonna work for you.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Excuse me?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Sure, sure. Women find you less threatening, they let their guards down.. and boom! You're like a stealth heterosexual.</p>

Rome.</font></p>

Rome. (Showing off to Phoebe and Chandler) I'm talking to Rome.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> So, uh, how's she doing?</font></p>

<p><font size="3">(Monica strides over to Ross, who is making coffee, and talks to him aside.)</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> She is unbelievable, our mother is...</font></p>

we still have boyfriends and your career to cover.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> Oh God!</font></p>

<p><font size="3">(They hug.)</font></p>

<p><font size="3">[Cut to the hospital, later. Everyone is talking about Nana.]</font></p>

Los. How she was always stealing them from- from restaurants.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> Y'know how-how the nurse said that-that Nana had passed? Well, she's not,
quite..</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Mrs. Geller:</b> What?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> She's not- past, she's present, she's back!</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Aunt Lillian:</b> (reentering) What's going on?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Mr. Geller:</b> She may have died.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> (exasperated) Yes, Chandler, that's exactly what it is. It's your hair.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, you have homosexual hair.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> Twice.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, that sucks!</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Joey:</b> You guys okay?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> I dunno, it's weird. I mean, I know she's gone, but I just don't feel,
uh...</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Phoebe:</b> Maybe that's 'cause she's not really gone.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> Nono, she's gone.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> We checked. A lot.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Phoebe:</b> Hm, I mean maybe no-one ever really goes. Ever since my mom died, every
now and then, I get this feeling that she's like right here, y'know? (She circles her hand
around her right shoulder. Chandler, sitting on her right, draws back nervously) Oh! And
Debbie, my best friend from junior high- got struck by lightning on a miniature golf
course- I always get this really strong Debbie vibe whenever I use one of those little
yellow pencils, y'know? ...I miss her.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> Aw. Hey, Pheebs, want this? (Gives her a pencil)</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh thanks!</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> Sure. I just sharpened her this morning.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Joey:</b> Now, see, I don't believe any of that. I think once you're dead, you're
dead! You're gone! You're worm food! (realises his tactlessness) ...So Chandler looks gay,
huh?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Phoebe:</b> Y'know, I dunno who this is, but it's not Debbie. (Hands back the
pencil)</font></p>

<p><font size="3">[Scene: Nana's house, Ross, Mrs. Geller and Aunt Lillian are going through clothes.]</font></p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Dad, let's just make a decision.</p>

<p><b>Mr. Geller:</b> You're right, it's crazy! It's going into the ground. We should just get the most basic thing.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Right. Would that be "the non-protective corrugated fiberboard with white laminate"? Dad we can't bury Nana in a dresser from IKEA.</p>

<p><b>Mr. Geller:</b> See? This is why your mother buys all my clothes. 'cause I hate to shop. I hate it!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Dad don't you think this is more about the fact that once you make the decision, it's like acknowledging Nana's actually gone?</p>

<p><b>Mr. Geller:</b> No I really hate to shop.</p>
 
<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> I thought it was gonna be a closed casket.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Mrs. Geller:</b> Well, that doesn't mean she can't look nice!</font></p>

<p><font size="3">(They open a cupboard which, amongst other things, contains a chest of drawers)</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Mrs. Geller:</b> Sweetie, you think you can get in there?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> (sarcastic) I don't see why not.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">(He tries pushing against the chest of drawers. Then he opens one of the drawers and
climbs into the closet using that; he falls behind the chest of drawers with a shout.)</font></p>

<p><font size="3">[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Monica is talking to her father.]</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> Dad!</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Mr. Geller:</b> Listen to me! When my time comes, I wanna be buried at sea.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> You what?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Mr. Geller:</b> I wanna be buried at sea, it looks like fun. </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Mr. Geller:</b> C'mon, you'll make a day of it! You'll get a boat, pack a lunch...</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> ...And then we throw your body in the water... Gee, that does sound fun.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Mr. Geller:</b> Everyone thinks they know me. Everyone says 'Jack Geller, so
predictable'. Maybe after I'm gone, they'll say 'Buried at sea! Huh!'.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> That's probably what they'll say.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Mr. Geller:</b> I'd like that.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> ...Quality, right, great.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Shelley:</b> Y'know, it's a shame, because you and Lowell would've made a great

<p><font size="3"><b>Shelley:</b> What? He's cute!</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Shelley:</b> Is Brian...?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> No! Uh, I d'know! The point is, if you were gonna set me up with
someone, I'd like to think you'd set me up with someone like him.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Shelley:</b> Well, I think Brian's a little out of your league.</font></p>

eternity in a lemon yellow pant-suit, go with the burgundy.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> No. Oh.. you don't get it! (Passes out and slumps across her)</font></p>

<p><font size="3">(Cut to Joey watching TV in the corner. He makes an extravagant gesture of
disappointment.)</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Mr. Geller:</b> Whaddya got there?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Joey:</b> (hides the TV, but he still has an earphone) Just a, uh... hearing
disability.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Mr. Geller:</b> What's the score?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Joey:</b> Seventeen-fourteen Giants... three minutes to go in the third.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Mr. Geller:</b> Beautiful! (Turns to watch with him)</font></p>

<p><font size="3">(Time lapse. A large crowd of men are now watching the game)</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> (still trapped under Ross) Pheebs, could you maybe hand me a cracker?</font></p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> OK.</p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Mrs. Geller: </b>(to Monica) Your grandmother would have hated this.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> Well, sure, what with it being her funeral and all.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Mrs. Geller:</b> No, I'd be hearing about 'Why didn't I get the honey-glazed ham?',
I didn't spend enough on flowers, and if I spent more she'd be saying 'Why are you wasting
your money? I don't need flowers, I'm dead'.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> That sounds like Nana.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Mrs. Geller:</b> Do you know what it's like to grow up with someone who is critical
of every single thing you say?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> ...I can imagine.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Mrs. Geller:</b> I'm telling you, it's a wonder your mother turned out to be the
positive, life-affirming person that she is.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> That is a wonder. So tell me something, Mom. If you had to do it all
over again, I mean, if she was here right now, would you tell her?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Mrs. Geller:</b> Tell her what?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> How she drove you crazy, picking on every little detail, like your
hair... for example.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Mrs. Geller:</b> I'm not sure I know what you're getting at.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> Do you think things would have been better if you'd just told her the
truth?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Mrs. Geller:</b> ...No. I think some things are better left unsaid. I think it's
nicer when people just get along. </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> Huh.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Mrs. Geller:</b> More wine, dear?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> Oh, I think so.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Mrs. Geller:</b> (reaches out to fiddle with Monica's hair again, and realises)
Those earrings look really lovely on you.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> Thank you. They're yours.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Mrs. Geller:</b> Actually they were Nana's.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">(There is a cry of disappointment from the crowd of men.) Oh my god!</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Mr. Geller:</b> Now I'm depressed! ...(To everyone) Even more than I was.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> Hey, who's this little naked guy?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> Oh That- that naked guy would be me.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> Aww, look at the little thing.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> Yes, yes, fine, that is my penis. Can we be grown-ups now?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> Who are those people?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> Got me.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> Oh, that's Nana, right there in the middle. (Reads the back) 'Me and the
gang at Java Joe's'. </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> Wow, Monica, you look just like your grandmother. How old was she there?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> Let's see, 1939... yeah, 24, 25?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> Looks like a fun gang. (They all look at each other and smile)</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Joey:</b> Ooh, look-look-look-look-look! I got Monica naked!</font></p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Let me see!</p>
