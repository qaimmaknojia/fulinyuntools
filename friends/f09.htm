<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> Terry, I, I, I know that I haven't worked here very long, but I was wondering, do you think it would be possible if I got a $100 advance in my salary?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Terry:</b> An advance?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> It's so that I can spend Thanksgiving with my family. See, every year we go skiing in Vail, and normally my father pays for my ticket, but I sort of started the whole independence thing, you know, which is actually why I took this job.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Terry:</b> Rachel, Rachel, sweetheart. You're a terrible, terrible waitress. Really, really awful.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> Ok, I, I hear what you're sayin'. I'm with you. Um, but I, but I'm trying really hard. And I think I'm doing better. I really do. Does anybody need coffee? (everyone in the place raises their hand) Oh, look at that.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> Excuse me, sir. Hi, you come in here all time. I was just wondering, do you think there's a possibility that you could give me an advance on my tips?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><strong>Guy:</strong> Huh?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> Ok, ok, that's fine. Fine. Hey, I'm sorry about that spill before. (picks up the tip he leaves) Only $98.50 to go. </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> Hey. Ross, did you know Mom and Dad are going to Puerto Rico for Thanksgiving?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> No, they're not.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> Yes, they are. The Blymens invited them.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> You're wrong.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> I am not wrong.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> You're wrong.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> No, I just talked to them.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Phoebe:</b> Hey.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> And this from the cry-for-help department. Are you wearing makeup?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Joey:</b> Yes, I am. As of today, I am officially Joey Tribbiani, actor slash model.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> That's so funny, 'cause I was thinking you look more like Joey Tribbiani, man slash woman.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Phoebe:</b> What were you modeling for?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Joey:</b> You know those posters for the city free clinic?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> Oh, wow, so you're gonna be one of those "healthy, healthy, healthy guys"?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Phoebe:</b> You know, the asthma guy was really cute.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> Do you know which one you're gonna be?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Joey:</b> No, but I hear lyme disease is open, so... (crosses fingers) </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> Good luck, man. I hope you get it.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Joey:</b> Thanks.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">(Ross comes back to the couch.)</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> (to Monica) Well, you were right. How can they do this to us, huh? It's Thanksgiving. </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> Ok, I'll tell you what. How about I cook dinner at my place? I'll make it just like Mom's.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> Will you make the mashed potatoes with the lumps?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> You know, they're not actually supposed to have... (Ross looks at her sheepishly) I'll work on the lumps. Joey, you're going home, right?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Joey:</b> Yeah.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> And I assume, Chandler, you are still boycotting all the pilgrim holidays.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> Yes, every single one of them.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> Phoebe, you're gonna be with your grandma?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Phoebe:</b> Yes, and her boyfriend. But we're celebrating Thanksgiving in December 'cause he is lunar.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> So you're free Thursday, then.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah. Oh, can I come?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> Yeah. Rach, are you thinking you're gonna make it to Vail?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> Absolutely. Shoop, shoop, shoop. Only a hundred and two dollars to go.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> I thought it was $98.50.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, well it was. I, I broke a cup.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> Well, I'm off to Carol's.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Phoebe:</b> Ooh, ooh! Why don't we invite her?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> (mimicking) Ooh, ooh. Because she's my ex-wife, and will probably want to bring her, ooh, ooh, lesbian life partner.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">[Scene: Carol and Susan's apartment, Susan is there. Ross enters.]</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> Hi, is uh, is Carol here?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Susan:</b> No, she's at a faculty meeting.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> Oh, I uh, just came by to pick up my skull. Well, not mine, but...<b>Susan:</b> Come in.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> Thanks. Yeah, Carol borrowed it for a class, and I have to get it back to the museum.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Susan:</b> What's it look like?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> Kinda like a big face without skin.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Susan:</b> Yes, I'm familiar with the concept. We can just look for it.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> Ok. (browsing the apartment) Wow, you guys sure have a lot of books about bein' a lesbian.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Susan:</b> Well, you know, you have to take a course. Otherwise, they don't let you do it. </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> (picking up a book) Hey, hey, Yertle the Turtle. A classic.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Susan:</b> Actually, I'm reading it to the baby.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> The uh, the baby that hasn't been born yet? Wouldn't that mean you're... crazy?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Susan:</b> What, you don't think they can hear sounds in there?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> You're not serious, I mean, you really... you really talk to it?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Susan:</b> Yeah, all the time. I want the baby to know my voice.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b>That's- that's just... Do you uh, do you talk about me?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Susan:</b> Yeah, yeah, all the time.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> Really?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Susan:</b> But um, we just refer to you as Bobo the Sperm Guy.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, everyone is there but Rachel.]</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> Look, if she's talking to it, I just think that I should get some belly time too. Not that I believe any of this.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, I believe it. I think the baby can totally hear everything. I can show you. OK, this will seem a little weird, but you put your head inside this turkey, and then we'll all talk, and you'll hear everything we say.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> I'd just like to say that I'm totally behind this experiment. In fact, I'd very much like to butter your head.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">(Rachel enters.)</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> Hey, Rach, did you make your money?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> No, not even close. Forget Vail, forget seeing my family, forget shoop, shoop, shoop.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> Rach, here's your mail.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> Thanks, you can just put it on the table.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> (insistently) No, here's your mail.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> Thanks, you can just put it on the table.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> (gives her an envelope) Would you just open it?</font></p>

<p><font size="3">(Rachel opens it. Inside is the money she needed.)</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> Oh my god, oh, you guys are great.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> We all chipped in.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Joey:</b> (to Monica) We did?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> (to Joey) You owe me 20 bucks.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> Thank you. Thank you so much!</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> (hands Chandler a bag) Chandler, here you go, got your traditional Thanksgiving feast, you got your tomato soup, your grilled cheese fixin's, and your family size bag of Funyuns.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> Wait, wait, Chandler, this is what you're havin' for Thanksgiving dinner? What, what, what is it with you and this holiday?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> All right, I'm nine years old.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> Oh, I hate this story.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> We just finished this magnificent Thanksgiving dinner. I have--and I remember this part vividly--a mouthful of pumpkin pie, and this is the moment my parents choose to tell me they're getting divorced.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> Oh my god.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> Yes yes. It's very difficult to appreciate a Thanksgiving dinner once you've seen it in reverse.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> Oh, what's this? I never saw them in mom's.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Pheobe:</b> It's a yam.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> Hello, This isn't a yam. Yam comes in the purple cans. They don't they don't they don't come in these!</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Pheobe:</b> OK, Ross, don't take this the wrong way or anything... but back off!</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><strong>Girl:</strong> We did?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, at Macy's. You were the Obsession girl, right? I was the Aramis guy. (pretends to spray cologne) Aramis? Aramis? </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><strong>Girl:</strong> Yeah, right.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Joey:</b> I gotta tell you. You're the best in the business.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><strong>Girl:</strong> Get out.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Joey:</b> I'm serious. You're amazing. You know when to spritz, you know when to lay back.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> I don't know. It's just not the same without Mom in the kitchen.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> That's not a question.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Joey:</b> But my mom always makes them. It's like a tradition. You get a little piece of turkey on your fork, a little cranberry sauce, and a tot! It's bad enough I can't be with my family because of my disease.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> All right, fine. Tonight's potatoes will be both mashed with lumps, and in the form of tots.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, I'm sorry, oh, I just, I thought we could have them whipped and then add some peas and onions.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> Why would we do that?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, 'cause then they'd be like my mom used to make them, you know, before she died.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> No, no, the actual cartoon character. Of course the balloon. It's all over the news. Right before he reached <em>Macy's</em>, he broke free and was spotted flying over Washington Square Park. I'm goin' to the roof, who's with me?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> I can't, I gotta go.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">(Short pause.)</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> Why would I have the keys?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> Aside from the fact that you said you had them?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> But I didn't.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> Well, you should have.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> Why?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> Because!</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> Why?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> Because!</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> Why? Because everything is my responsibility? Isn't it enough that I'm making Thanksgiving dinner for everyone? You know, everyone wants a different kind of potatoes, so I'm making different kinds of potatoes. Does anybody care what kind of potatoes I want? Nooooo, no, no! (starting to cry) Just as long as Phoebe gets her peas and onions, and Mario gets his tots, and it's my first Thanksgiving, and it's all burned, and, and I... I...</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> Ok, Monica, only dogs can hear you now, so, look, the door's open. Here we go.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">(They walk in. Smoke fills the apartment.)</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Joey:</b> Hi Chandler, don't lose this.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, no no no!</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> Well, Well, well, the turkey's burnt. (checking pots) Potatoes are ruined, potatoes are ruined, potatoes are ruined.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">(Ross enters, singing.)</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> Here we come, walkin' down the&#8212;this doesn't smell like Mom's.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> No, it doesn't, does it? But you wanted lumps, Ross? (picks up the pan of badly burnt potatoes) Well, here you go, buddy, ya got one.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> Don't yell at me! You burned dinner!</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Phoebe:</b> Hey! Don't make her squeak again!</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, god, this is great! The plane is gone, so I guess I'm stuck here with you guys.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Joey:</b> Hey, we all had better plans, ok? This was nobody's first choice.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> Oh, really? So why was I busting my ass to make this delicious Thanksgiving dinner?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Joey:</b> You call that delicious? </font></p>

<p><font size="3">(all shouting)</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> Stop it, stop it, stop it!</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> Now this feels like Thanksgiving.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">[Time lapse. Everyone is upset with each other. Phoebe is at the window.]</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> Oh skiing. Shoop, shoop, shoop.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> Shoop!</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Phoebe:</b> Ooh. </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> What?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Phoebe:</b> Ugly Naked Guy's taking his turkey out of the oven. Oh it is celebrating. Oh my god. He's not alone. Ugly Naked Guy's having Thanksgiving dinner with Ugly Naked Gal.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">(They all run to the window.)</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Joey:</b> I've gotta see this. All right Ugly Naked Guy!</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> Ooh, Ugly Naked Dancing!</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Phoebe:</b> It's nice that he has someone.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">[Time lapse. The gang is around the table, eating grilled cheese sandwiches.]</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> Shall I carve?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> By all means.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> Alright.. OK, who wants light cheese, and who wants dark cheese?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> I don't even wanna know about the dark cheese.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> (holding sandwich) Does anybody wanna split this with me?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Joey:</b> Oh, I will.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Phoebe:</b> Ooh, you guys have to make a wish.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> Make a wish?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Phoebe:</b> Come on, you know, Thanksgiving. Ooh, you got the bigger half. What'd you wish for?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Joey:</b> The bigger half.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> Alright, I'd like to propose a toast. Little toast here, ding ding. I know this isn't the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting. Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know? So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>All:</b> That's so sweet.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> And hey, here's to a lousy Christmas.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> And a crappy New Year.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> Here, here!</font></p>
