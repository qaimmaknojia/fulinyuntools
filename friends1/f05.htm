one little maneuver, and bam, a bra right out the sleeve. All right, as far as I'm
concerned, there is nothing a guy can do that even comes close. Am I right?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> Not even, say, breaking up with Janice?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, right, right, shut up.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> Chandler, nobody likes breaking up with someone. Except for Kavin Millmore, may he rot in hell. You just gotta do it.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> No, I know, but it's just so hard, you know? I mean, you're sitting
there with her, she has no idea what's happening, and then you finally get up the courage
to do it, and there's the horrible awkward moment when you've handed her the note... And she try to y'know, run out of the restaurant before she's actually finished the note..</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> It's my father. He wants to give me a Mercedes convertible.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Joey:</b> No, yeah, no, ok, but not yet. I don't wanna seem too eager. One
Mississippi, two Mississippi, three Mississippi. That seems pretty cool. (he walks over to
her) Hey, Angela. </font></p>

there too?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> Me. Was that not clear? Hey, why don't, um, why don't I just join you
both, there?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> Yes.., I do have a laundry room in my building.., um, but there's a.... rat

through?</font></p>
