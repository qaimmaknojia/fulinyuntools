		<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> You did so. I swear, I swear&#8212;(noticing Kristin's absence) How long has she been in the bathroom?</font></p>

		<p><font size="3"><b>Carol:</b> Uh, I don't think she's in the bathroom. Her coat is gone.</font></p>

		<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> Well maybe it's cold in there. Or maybe I screwed up the first date I had in 9 years. </font></p>

		<p><font size="3"><b>Carol:</b> That could be it.</font></p>

		<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> Oh, god. (He puts his head down on the grill) You know, this is still pretty hot. (He picks his head up, and a mushroom sticks to his head. Carol picks it off and eats it.)</font></p>

		<p><font size="3"><b>Carol:</b> Mushroom. Smile. They won't all be like this. Some women might even stay through dinner. Sorry, that's not funny</font></p>

		<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> No, it's just...you know the whole "getting on with your life" thing. Well, do I have to? I mean, I'm sitting here with this cute woman, and, and, and she's perfectly nice, and, but that there's, that's it. And um, and then I'm here talkin' to you, and, and it's easy, and it's fun, and, and I don't, I don't have to...You know, here's a wacky thought. Um, what's say you and I give it another shot? No no no, I know what you're gonna say, you're a lesbian. But what do you say we just put that aside for now you know? Let's just stick a pin in it, ok? Because, we're great together, you know. You can't deny it. Besides, I've got a ring at home that fits you. I've got uh- lots of pictures with both of us in them. And best of all, hey, hey! you're carrying my baby. I mean, how perfect is that? But see, you know, you keep sayin' that, but there's somethin' right here. I love you.</font></p>

		<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> No but, no but.</font></p>

		<p><font size="3"><b>Carol:</b> You know that thing you put over here with the pin in it? It's time to take the pin out. You'll find someone, I know you will. The right woman is just waiting for you.</font></p>

		<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> That's easy for you to say, you found one already.</font></p>

		<p><font size="3"><b>Carol:</b> All you need is a woman who likes men and you'll be set.</font></p>
