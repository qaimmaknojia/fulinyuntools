<p><font size="3"><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, y'know, these are not her boobies, these are her breasts.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Mr. Tribbiani:</b> Remember when you were a little kid, I used to take you to the

double life. He's like actually some spy, working for the C.I.A. (Considers) That'd be
cool.... This blows!</font></p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Do you think dad would cheat mom?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No, I don't think so. 'cause that would involve having sex and I'd like to think that our parents don't do that.</p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> I know, I mean, why can't parents just stay parents? (She walks over
near Chandler and his gaze stays very obviously on her chest) Why do they have to become
people? Why do they have... (Notices Chandler) Why... can't you stop staring at my breasts?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> (Without looking up) What? (Looks up) What?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> Did you not get a good enough look the other day?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> Alright, alright. We're all adults here, there's only one way to resolve
this. Since you saw her boobies, I think, uh, you're gonna have to show her your peepee.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, it's nothing, it's a little thing... I hate that guy.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> What, so he was a little analytical. That's what he does, y'know? C'mon,
he's not that bad.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">(Cut to Chandler, Ross and Roger sitting at the table. Ross is upset)</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> Y'see, that's where you're wrong. Why would I marry her if I thought on
any level thatthat she was a lesbian?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> Why? Why would I why? Why? Why? Why?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Roger:</b> I don't know. Maybe maybe low self-esteem, maybe maybe to compensate for
overshadowing a sibling, maybe you...</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> Wait-wait, go back to that sibling thing.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Roger:</b> Well, I don't know. I mean, it's conceivable that you wanted to sabotage
your marriage so that the sibling would feel less of a failure in the eyes of the parents.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> That that's ridiculous! I don't feel guilty for her failures!</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> Nonono, thatthat's not what I was saying...</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> Y'know, all these years, I thought you were on my side. But maybe what
you were doing was sucking up to Mom and Dad so they'd keep liking you better!</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> Hey, I married a lesbian to make you look good!</font></p>

<p><font size="3">(Cut to later. Rachel is in tears)</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> You're right! I mean you're right! It wasn't just the Weebles, but it
was the Weeble Play Palace, and and the Weebles' Cruise Ship. Oh, which had this little
lifeboat for the Weebles to wobble in. And Mom just gave them all away.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Roger:</b> That's tough. Tough stuff. C'mon, Pheebs, we're gonna catch that movie,

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> We're sorry, Pheebs, we're sorry.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Phoebe:</b> Uh-huh. Okay. Okay, don't you think, maybe, though, it's just that he's
so perceptive that it freaks you out?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>All:</b> ...No, we hate him.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">[Scene: Chandler and Joey's apartment, Joey is trying to turn the sofabed back into a
sofa. Someone knocks on the door and it rears up at him.]</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Joey:</b> Ma! What're you doing here?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Mrs. Tribbiani:</b> I came to give you this (Gives him a bag of groceries) and this.
(Whacks him round the ear)</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Joey:</b> Oww! Big ring!</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Mrs. Tribbiani:</b> Why did you have to fill your father's head with all that
garbage about making things right? Things were fine the way they were! There's chicken in
there, put it away. For God's sake, Joey, really. (She gives the sofabed a tiny push and
it folds away)</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Joey:</b> Hold on, you-you knew?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Mrs. Tribbiani:</b> Of course I knew! What did you think? Your father is no James
Bond. You should've heard some of his cover stories. "I'm sleeping over at my
accountant's," I mean, what is that? Please!</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Joey:</b> So then how could you I mean, how could you?!</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Mrs. Tribbiani:</b> Do you remember how your father used to be? Always yelling,
always yelling nothing made him happy, nothing made him happy, not that wood shop, not
those stupid little ships in the bottle, nothing. Now he's happy! I mean, it's nice, he
has a hobby.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Joey:</b> Ma, I don't mean to be disrespectful, but... what the hell are you talking
about?! I mean, what about you?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Mrs. Tribbiani:</b> Me? I'm fine. Look, honey, in an ideal world, there'd be no her,
and your father would look like Sting. And I'll tell you something else. Ever since that
poodle-stuffer came along, he's been so ashamed of himself that he's been more attentive,
he's been more loving... I mean, it's like every day's our anniversary.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Joey:</b> I'm...happy...for you?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Mrs. Tribbiani:</b> Well don't be, because now everything's screwed up. I just want
it the way it was.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Joey:</b> Ma, I'm sorry. I just did what I thought you'd want.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Mrs. Tribbiani:</b> I know you did, cookie. Oh, I know you did. So tell me. Did you
see her?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Joey:</b> Yeah. You're ten times prettier than she is.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Mrs. Tribbiani:</b> That's sweet. Could I take her?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Joey:</b> With this ring? (Her engagement ring.) No contest.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh sorry, I'm sorry. I just I just have a thing, which means you can't ever do that.</font></p>

<p><b>Roger:</b> What- what's wrong, sweetie?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Nothing. Nothing.</p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Roger:</b> Aaaah, what's wrong, c'mon. (Pats his leg. She lies down and rests her
head in his lap)</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Phoebe:</b> OK. It's, I mean, it's nothing, I'm fine. It's just- It's my friends. They-they have a
liking problem with you. In that, um, they don't.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Roger:</b> Oh. They don't.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Phoebe:</b> But y'know? They don't see all the wonderfulness that I see. Y'know, they don't see all
the good stuff and all the sweet stuff. They just think you're a little...</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Phoebe:</b> You're not? See, that's why you're so great! </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Roger:</b> Actually it's, it's quite, y'know, typical behaviour when you have this
kind of dysfunctional group dynamic. Y'know, this kind of co-dependant, emotionally
stunted, sitting in your stupid coffee house with your stupid big cups which, I'm sorry,
might as well have nipples on them, and you're all like 'Oh, define me! Define me! Love
me, I need love!'.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Joey:</b> Yeah. He's gonna keep cheating on my ma like she wanted, she's gonna keep
pretending she doesn't know even though she does, and my little sister Tina can't see her
husband any more because he got a restraining order...which has nothing to do with
anything except that I found out today.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, I guess. It's just- y'know, they're parents, after a certain point, you gotta let go.
Even if you know better, you've gotta let them make their own mistakes.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> Just think, in a couple of years we get to turn into them.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> If I turn into my parents, I'll either be an alcoholic blond chasing
