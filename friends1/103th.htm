<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> Hey. Oh, oh, how'd it go? </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Phoebe:</b> Um, not so good. He walked me to the subway and said 'We should do this
again!' </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>All:</b> Ohh. Ouch. </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> What? He said 'we should do it again', that's good, right? </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> Uh, no. Loosely translated 'We should do this again' means 'You will
never see me naked'. </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> Since when? </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Joey:</b> Since always. It's like dating language. Y'know, like 'It's not you' means
'It is you'. </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> Or 'You're such a nice guy' means 'I'm gonna be dating leather-wearing
alcoholics and complaining about them to you'. </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Phoebe:</b> Or, or, y'know, um, 'I think we should see other people' means 'Ha, ha,
I already am'. </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> And everybody knows this? </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Joey:</b> Yeah. Cushions the blow. </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, it's like when you're a kid, and your parents put your dog to
sleep, and they tell you it went off to live on some farm. </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> That's funny, that, no, because, uh, our parents actually did, uh, send
our dog off to live on a farm. </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> Uh, Ross. </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> What? Wh- hello? The Millners' farm in Connecticut? The Millners, they had
this unbelievable farm, they had horses, and, and rabbits that he could chase and it was-
it w- .....Oh my God, Chi Chi! </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> "So how does it feel knowing you're about to die?" </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Joey:</b> "Warden, in five minutes my pain will be over. But you'll have to
live with the knowledge that you sent an honest man to die." </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> Hey, that was really good! </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Joey:</b> Thanks! Let's keep going. </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> Okay. "So. Whaddya want from me, Damone, huh?" </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Joey:</b> "I just wanna go back to my cell. 'Cause in my cell, I can
smoke." </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> "Smoke away." </font></p>

<p><font size="3">(Joey takes out a pack of cigarettes and a lighter.&nbsp; He fumbles and drops the
lighter.&nbsp; Then he lights a cigarett, takes a drag, and coughs.)</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> I think this is probably why Damone smokes in his cell alone. </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Joey:</b> What? </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> Relax your hand! Let your wrist go.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> Hey! </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Joey:</b> Hey! </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> Alright, now try taking a puff. </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> Alright.. okay. No. Give it to me. </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Joey:</b> No no no, I am not giving you a cigarette. </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> It's fine, it's fine. Look, do you wanna get this part, or not? Here. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">(Joey reluctantly gives him the cigarette.) </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> Alright, now, don't think of it as a cigarette. Think of it as the thing that's been
missing from your hand. When you're holding it, you feel right. You feel complete. </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Joey:</b> Y'miss it? </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> Nah, not so much. Alright, now we smoke. (Takes a puff.) Oh.. my..
God. (He continues to smoke.) </font></p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Chandler, gimme that.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Nonono, you got your option there, you can hold it like that, or you can hold it in your mouth, smoke like this...</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Alright you try.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> OK.. OK how's this?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> OK that's not bad. Alright now when you finish it's really cool when you flick it you kinda flick it flick it.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> That's good.. Alright you keep practicing and I'll go put out the sofa.</p>

<p><font size="3">[Scene, Central Perk, everyone except Phoebe and Rachel is there.] </font></p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I thought it was like the size of the guy's feet...</p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> No, nononono. They say it's the same as the distance from the tip of a
guy's thumb to the tip of his index finger. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">(The guys stretch out their fingers.) </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Joey:</b> That's ridiculous! </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> Can I use.. either thumb? </font></p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I'd rather go with the foot theory.</p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> (carrying a tray of drinks) Alright, don't tell me, don't tell me!
(Starts handing them out.) Decaf cappucino for Joey.. Coffee black.. Latte.. And an iced
tea. I'm getting pretty good at this! </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>All:</b> Yeah. Yeah, excellent. </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> (leaving to serve others) Good for me! </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah- no- I'm just- it's, I haven't worked- It's my bank. </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> What did they do to you? </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Phoebe:</b> It's nothing, it's just- Okay. I'm going through my mail, and I open up
their monthly, you know, STATEMENT- </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> Easy. </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Phoebe:</b> - and there's five hundred extra dollars in my account. </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, Satan's minions at work again... </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Phoebe:</b> Yes, 'cause now I have to go down there, and deal with them. </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Joey:</b> What are you talking about? Keep it! </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Phoebe:</b> It's not mine, I didn't earn it, if I kept it, it would be like
stealing. </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, but if you spent it, it would be like shopping! </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay. Okay, let's say I bought a really great pair of shoes. Do you know
what I'd hear, with every step I took? 'Not-mine. Not-mine. Not-mine.' And even if I was
happy, okay, and, and skipping- I'd hear 'Not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not-mine,
not-not-mine'... </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> We're with you. We got it. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">(Chandler leans over the back of the couch out of sight.) </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay. I'd- just- I'd never be able to enjoy it. It would be like this
giant karmic debt. </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> Chandler, what are you doing? </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> (puling him up) Hey. Whaddya doing? </font></p>

<p><font size="3">(Chandler tries to shrug nonchalantly but eventually he has to exhale a mouthful of
smoke.)</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>All:</b> Oh! Oh, God! </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> What is this?! </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> I'm smoking. I'm smoking, I'm smoking. </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, I can't believe you! You've been so good, for three years! </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> And this- is my reward! </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> Hold on a second, alright? Just think about what you went through the last
time you quit. No you know when you forget about you, think about what we went through the last time you quit!</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, so this time I won't quit! </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>All:</b> Ohhh! Put it out! </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> All right! I'm putting it out, I'm putting it out. (He drops it in
Phoebe's coffee.) </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, no! I- I can't drink this now! </font></p>

to figure that out. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">[Scene: Iridium, Monica and Paula are at work.]</font></p>

within five minutes they're all over him. I mean, they're like- coyotes, picking off the
weak members of the herd. </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Paula:</b> Listen. As someone who's seen more than her fair share of bad beef, I'll
tell you: that is not such a terrible thing. Come on madam, your friends're just
looking out after you. </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> I know. I just wish that once, I'd bring a guy home that they actually
liked. </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Paula:</b> Well, you do realise the odds of that happening are a little slimmer if
they never get to meet the guy.. </font></p>
