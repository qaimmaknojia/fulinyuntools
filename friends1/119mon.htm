<p><font size="3"><b>Joey:</b> Hey, I don't need violence to enjoy a movie. Just so long as there's a little nudity.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> There was nudity!</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Joey:</b> I meant <strong>female </strong>nudity. Alright? I don't need to see Lou Grant frolicking.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> I can't believe we are even having this discussion.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Joey:</b> I agree. I'm, like, in disbelief.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> I mean, don't you think if things were gonna happen with Rachel, they would've happened already?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> I'm telling you, she said she's looking for a relationship with someone exactly like me.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Joey:</b> She really said that?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> Well, I added the 'exactly like me' part... But she said she's looking for someone, and someone is gonna be there tonight.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Joey:</b> 'Tonight' tonight?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> Well, I think it's perfect. Y'know, it's just gonna be the two of us, she spent all day taking care of my monkey...</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> I can't remember the last time I got a girl to take care of my monkey.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> Anyway, I figured after work I'd go pick up a bottle of wine, go over there and, uh, try to woo her.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> Hey, y'know what you should do? You should take her back to the 1890's, when that phrase was last used.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is taking care of Marcel and they are watching a soap opera.]</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> Now, now the one in the feather boa, that's Dr. Francis. Now, she used to be a man. Okay, now look, see, there's Raven. We hate her. We're glad she's dying. Okay- (Marcel pushes down a cushion to reveal a shoe) Wh- wh- Marcel, are you playing with Monica's shoes? You know you're not supposed to pl- whoah whoah. Marcel, did you poo in the shoe? (Takes the shoe into the kitchen) Marcel, bad monkey! Oh! Oh! (She notices the newsletter and taps the contents of the shoes onto it, then folds it shut) Sorry, Barry. Little engagement gift. I'm sure you didn't register for that. (She leaves the apartment holding the newsletter at arm's length. However, she leaves the door open. Marcel runs out in the opposite direction. There is a shot from the TV and Rachel runs back in) Who died? Who died? Roll him over! Oh, c'mon, roll him over! Oh...! Well, we know it wasn't Dexter, right Marcel? Because- (Looks down and notices he is missing) Marcel? Marcel? Marc- (Notices the open door)</font></p>

<p><font size="3">[Time lapse. Now everyone but Ross and Phoebe is back at Monica and Rachel's.]</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Joey:</b> How could you lose him?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> I don't know. We were watching TV, and then he pooped in Monica's shoe-</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> Wait. He pooped in my shoe? Which one?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> I don't know. The left one.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> Which <strong>ones</strong>?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> Oh. Oh, those little clunky Amish things you think go with everything.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Joey:</b> Alright alright. You're a monkey. You're loose in the city. Where do you go?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, it's his first time out, so he's probably gonna wanna do some of the touristy things. I'll go to <em>Cats</em>, you go to the <em>Russian Tea Room</em>.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, my, God, c'mon, you guys! He's gonna be home any minute! He's gonna kill me!</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> Okay, we'll start with the building. You guys take the first and second floor, Phoebe and I'll take third and fourth.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> Well, what'm I gonna do? What'm I gonna do?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> Okay, you stay here, and just wait by the phone. Spray <em>Lysol </em>in my shoe, and wait for Ross to kill you.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">(They all leave)</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> Anybody wanna trade? Oh...</font></p>

<p><font size="3">[Cut to a hallway in the building, Monica and Phoebe are knocking on a door. Mr. Heckles emerges.]</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> Mr. Heckles, our friend lost a monkey. Have you seen it?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> No!</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Phoebe:</b> Why would you leave your Belgian waffle in the hall?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Mr. Heckles:</b> I wasn't ready for it.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> A monkey. Have you seen a monkey?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Mr. Heckles:</b> Saw Regis Philbin once...</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay, thank you, Mr. Heckles. (They move off)</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Mr. Heckles:</b> You owe me a waffle.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">[Cut to Monica and Rachel's.]</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> (On the phone) Okay, he's a, he's a black capuchian monkey with a white face... (Enter Ross) ...with, with Russian dressing and, and pickles on the side. Okay. Thanks.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> Hey. How did, uh, how'd it go today?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> Great! It went great. Really great. Hey, is that wine?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> Yeah. You, uh, you want some?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, I would love some. But y'know what? Y'know what? Let's not drink it here. I'm feeling kinda crazy. You wanna go to Newark?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> Uh, okay, yeah, we could do that, but before we head off to the murder capital of the North-East, I was, uh, kinda wanting to run something by you. Y'know how we were, uh, y'know, talking before about, uh, relationships and stuff? (Uncorks the wine) Well-</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> Oh God, Ross, I cannot do this.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> Okay, quick and painful. (Starts to cork the wine) </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> I know, I know, I'm sorry-</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> No, y'know what, I guess it's partially my fault. Y'know, I shouldn't've, uh, asked you to start off with a monkey. I should've started you off with like a pen or a pencil.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> (Tearfully) Ross, I'm doing everything that I can, I've got everybody looking for him, and I- (Door buzzer goes and she runs to get it) Oh! Who is it?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><strong>Intercom:</strong> Animal Control.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> See? I've even called Animal Control!</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> You called Animal Control?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> Uh-huh... why... do you not like them?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> Marcel is an <strong>illegal </strong>exotic animal. I'm not allowed to have him in the city. If they find him, they'll take him away from me.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> O-okay, now see, you never ever ever told us that...</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> That's right, I.. 'cause I didn't expect you were gonna invite them to the apartment!</font></p>

<p><font size="3">(A knock on the door. Rachel swiftly opens it)</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> Hi, thanks for coming.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><strong>Luisa: </strong>(Animal Control) Somebody called about a monkey?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, y'know what? That was a complete misunderstanding! (Ross puts his arms around her and they act all sweetness and light)</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, we thought we had a monkey, but we-we didn't.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> Turned out it was a hat.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> Cat!</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> Cat! What'm I saying? Cat!</font></p>

<p><font size="3">(Luisa nods, but then Monica and Phoebe run in)</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> Hi. We checked the third and fourth floor, no-one's seen Marcel.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Luisa:</b> Marcel?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> My uncle Marcel.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, is that who the monkey's named after?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Luisa:</b> Oookay. Are you aware that possession of an illegal exotic is, uh, punishable by up to two years in prison and confiscation of the animal?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh my God. You'd put that poor little creature in jail?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> Pheebs, you remember how we talked about saying things quietly to yourself first?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Phoebe:</b> Yes, but there isn't always time!</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> Look. I'm sure there's some friendly way to reconcile this! Um, have a seat. First of all, we haven't been introduced, I'm Monica Geller.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Luisa:</b> Oh my God, you are! And you're Rachel Green!</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah!</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Luisa:</b> Luisa Gianetti! Lincoln High? I sat behind you guys in home room!</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Luisa:</b> You have no idea who I am, do you.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> No, none at all.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> None.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Luisa:</b> Well, maybe that's because you spent four years ignoring me. I mean, would it have been so hard to say 'Morning, Luisa'? Or 'Nice overalls'?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> Oh, I'm- I'm so sorry!</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Luisa:</b> Ah, it's not so much you, you were fat, you had your own problems. (To Rachel) But you? What a <strong>bitch</strong>!</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> What?!</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> Be that as it may, d'you think you could just help us out here on that monkey thing? Y'know, just for old times' sake? Go Bobcats?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Luisa:</b> I could... but I won't. If I find that monkey, he's mine. (Leaves)</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Woman No. 1:</b> No. No, haven't seen a monkey. Do you know anything about fixing radiators?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Joey:</b> Um, sure! Did you, uh, did you try turning the knob back the other way?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Woman No. 1:</b> Of course.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">(Joey and Chandler shoot each other glances)</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Woman No. 1:</b> Just a sec. (To Chandler and Joey) Hope you find your monkey. (She starts to shut the door)</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, nononowaitwaitwaitnono! Uh... we may not know anything about radiators per se, but we do have a certain amount of expertise in the heating and cooling... milieu.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Joey:</b> Uh, aren't we kind of in the middle of something here?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> Yes, but these women are very hot, and they need our help! And they're very hot.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Joey:</b> We can't, alright? (To the women) We're sorry. You have no idea how sorry, but... We promised we'd find this monkey.

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> Ross, I said I'm sorry like a million times. What do you want me to do? You want me to break my foot too? Okay, I'm gonna break my foot, right here. (Kicks the sign) Ow!! Oh! Oh my God, oh my God! There, are you <strong>happy</strong> now?!</font></p>

For the most part, look, if you take this monkey, I will lose one of the most important people in my life. You can hate me if you want, but please do not punish him.
