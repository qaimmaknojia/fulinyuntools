<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> I'm sure everything's fine. Has her water broke yet?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> I don't know, but when I spoke to her, she said she had already passed the mucus plug.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> God, I don't believe this. She could be giving birth in the cab.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, Ross, relax. It's probably like two dollars for the first contraction, and then fifty cents for each additional contraction.</font></p>

And here's this little baby who has like three whole parents who care about it so much that they're fighting over who gets to love it the most. And it's not even born yet. It's just, it's just the luckiest baby in the whole world. (pause) I'm sorry, you were fighting.</font></p>
