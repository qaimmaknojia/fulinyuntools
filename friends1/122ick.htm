<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> Look at you, you won't even look at him.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> (sarcastically) Oh, come on tell me. I could use another reason why women won't look at me.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> All right, all right, all right. Last night, I had a dream that, uh, you and I, were...</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Phoebe:</b> Doing it on this table. (points at the table)</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> Why, why, why would you dream that?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> More importantly, was I any good?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> Well, you were pretty damn good.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> Interesting, cause in my dreams, I'm allways surprisingly inadequate. (Monica pats him on his lap)</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> I'm sorry, it was a one-time-thing. I was very drunk and I was in somebody else's subconscious.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Phoebe:</b> (points at Joey's pen) Uh, uh, gimme. Can you see me operating a drill press?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> Pheebs, why would you want to operate a drill press?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Phoebe:</b> Just for some short-term-work. You know, until I get back some of my massage clients.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> Pirates again?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Phoebe:</b> No, nothing like that. I was just... such a dummie. I taught this "massage-yourself-at-home-workshop." And they are.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Joey:</b> Hey, hey, Chan. She could work for you.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> (sarcasticly) Thanks Joey, that's a good idea.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Phoebe:</b> I could be a secretary.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> Well, you know Phoebs. I don't know if it's your kinda thing, because it involves a lot of being normal. For a large portion of the day.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> Is it like for dinosaur emergencies. 'Help, come quick, they're still extinct.'</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> No, it's for when Carol goes into labor. She can get me wherever I am. I mean, all she has to do is to dial 55-JIMBO.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> A cool phone number, and a possible name for the kid.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> All right, I'll see you guys later. (raises)</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> And this manchild has no problem with how old you are?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> No, of course not. It's not even an issue. Cause I told him I was 22.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><strong>All:</strong> What?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> Oh, I can't pass for 22?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> Well, now, I actually have to get to work.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> Just a touch. Mon, I don't understand. I mean, you've been dating this guy since like, what... his midterms? I mean, why all the sudden are you so... Oh.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Young Ethan:</b> Oh god, don't tell me, I did it wrong.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> No-no. Nothing wrong about that. </font></p>
