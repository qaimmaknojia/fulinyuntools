<p>[Scene: Monica and her mother at a restaurant.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Mother, all I am saying is just for once, can we go to lunch and not talk about what I'm wearing or how long is my hair or where my career is going?.. Or who I'm dating!</p>

<p><b>Mrs. Geller:</b> Oh..</p>

<p><b>Waiter:</b> So are you ready for the check?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> God, yes. I'll take it!</p>

<p><b>Mrs. Geller:</b> No, darling.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I said I'll take it! Here, take it, go, run!</p>

<p><b>Mrs. Geller:</b> It's very sweet. And on what they pay you.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Career.. Mom you don't have to worry about me. OK? I'm doing fine.</p>

<p><b>Waiter:</b> I'm afraid this has been denied.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> That's impossible!</p>

<p><b>Mrs. Geller:</b> That's all right, dear. Here you go.</p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Joey:</b> How could someone get a hold of your credit card number?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> I have no idea. But look how much they spent!</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> Monica, would you calm down? The credit card people said that you only have to pay for the stuff that you bought.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> I know. It's just such reckless spending.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> I think when someone steals your credit card, they've kind of already thrown caution to the wind.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> Wow, what a geek. They spent $69.95 on a Wonder Mop.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> That's me.</font></p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> You see when I say geek, I mean.. Oh the hell with it, you bought a $70 mop, you're a geek.

<p><font size="3"><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh! The yuk! Ross, he's doing it again! (Points to a lamp which is shaking behind the sofa)</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> Marcel, stop humping the lamp! Stop humping! Now Marcel, come back- (Marcel runs toward Rachel's room) come here, Marcel-</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> Oh no, not in my room! I'll get him.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> Ross, you've got to do something about the humping.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> What? It's, it's just a phase.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> Well, that's what we said about Joey...</font></p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> You'd think you guys would be just a little more understanding, y'know?</p>
	
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I know, but we're not.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> OK. Would you all relax? It's not that big a deal.</p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> (Out of shot) Marcel! Stop it! Marcel! Bad monkey!</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> What?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> Oh.. Let's just say my Curious George doll is no longer curious.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> This woman's living my life.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> What?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> She's living my life, and she's doing it better than me! Look at this, look. She buys tickets for plays that I wanna see. She, she buys clothes from stores that I'm intimidated by the sales people. She spent three hundred dollars on art supplies.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> You're not an artist.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> Yeah, well I might be if I had the supplies! I mean, I could do all this stuff. Only I don't.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, Monica, c'mon, you do cool things.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> Oh really? Okay, let's compare, shall we.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> (Yawning) Oh, it's so late for 'Shall we'...</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> Do I go horseback riding in the park? Do I take classes at the New School?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> (Yawning) Nooo...</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> No.. This is so unfair! She's got everything I want, and she doesn't have my mother.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">[Scene: Central Perk, Joey and Chandler are discussing stage names.]</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> How about Joey... Pepponi?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Joey:</b> No, still too ethnic. My agent thinks I should have a name that's more neutral.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> Joey... Switzerland?</font></p>

<p><font size="3">(The waitress brings their coffee.)</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Joey:</b> Plus, y'know, I think it should be Joe. Y'know, Joey makes me sound like I'm, I dunno, this big. (Waitress looks at him funny) Which I'm not.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> Joe...Joe...Joe...Stalin?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Joey:</b> Stalin... Stalin... do I know that name? It sounds familiar.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> Well, it does not ring a bell with me... but you're more plugged into that show business thing.. </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Joey:</b> (Writes it down) Joe Stalin. Y'know, y'know, that's pretty good.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> You might wanna try Joseph.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">(Joey visibly thinks 'Of course!' and writes it down.)</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Joey:</b> Joseph Stalin. I think you'd remember that!</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> Oh yes! Bye Bye Birdie, starring Joseph Stalin. Joseph Stalin is the Fiddler on the Roof.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> Hi. (On the phone) Hi, uh, yes, this is Monica Geller. Um, I believe I'm taking some classes with you and I was wondering what they were.. Oh.. I've had a recent head injury and certain numbers and dates.. Barbecue! Oh, did I? See, there you go.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Phoebe:</b> What are you doing?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> (Hushes her) Alright, great. Great. Thanks a lot. (Hangs up) I'm going to tap class.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> What, what, so that you can dance with the woman that stole your credit card?</font></p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I wanna see what she looks like. </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> You just go to the post office! I'm sure they got her picture up!</p>
 
<p><b>Monica:</b> This woman's got my life, I should get to see who she is.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay, Monica, y'know what, honey, you're kinda losing it here! I mean, this is really becoming like a weird obsession thing.</p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Phoebe:</b> This is madness. It's madness, I tell you, <strong>for the love of God, Monica, don't do it</strong>!! ...Thank you.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> Oh, no thanks, we're just here to observe.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Teacher:</b> You don't observe a dance class. You <strong>dance</strong></font><font size="3">a dance class. Spare shoes are over there.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> What does she mean?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Phoebe:</b> I think she means (Imitates) 'You <strong>dance</strong></font><font size="3">a dance class'. Oh, c'mon, c'mon. (They put on some spare shoes)</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> Okay, d'y'see anybody you think could be me?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Teacher:</b> (To the class) People! Last time there were some empty yoghurt containers lying around after class. Let's not have that happen again!</font></p>

<p><font size="3">(Rachel taps into view; she is in perfect sync with the rest of the class)</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> What? You just click when they click.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Teacher:</b> Alright people, now everyone grab a partner.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">(The girls are unsure how to pair off. Phoebe settles it)</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><strong>Phoebe and </strong><b>Rachel:</b> Aww.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Teacher:</b> Well that's all right, you can come up to the front and dance with me.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">(She starts to walk very slowly toward the front of the room. The teacher grabs her hand and pulls her. Suddenly a woman bursts in)</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Fake Monica:</b> You're kidding! I-I spent three years in Amsterdam. (Asks her something in Dutch)</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><strong>Chandler and </strong><b>Joey:</b> Hey.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Joey:</b> Where've you been?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> I just come back from the vet.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> She's not gonna make you wear one of those big plastic cones, is she?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> She says Marcel's humping thing's not a phase. Apparently he's reached sexual maturity.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Joey:</b> (To Chandler) Hey! He beat ya.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> She says as time goes on, he's gonna start getting agressive and violent.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> So what does this mean?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> I'm gonna have to give him up.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">[Scene: Central Perk, scene continued from earlier.&nbsp; They guys are sitting there like the Three Monkeys.]</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Joey:</b> I can't believe it, Ross. This sucks!</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> I don't get it, I mean, you just got him. How can he be an adult already?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> I know. I know. I mean, one day, he's this little thing, and before you know it, he's this little thing I can't get off my leg.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Joey:</b> Isn't there any way you can keep him?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> No, no. The vet says unless he's in a place where he has regular access to some... monkey lovin,' he's just gonna get vicious. I've just gotta get him into a zoo.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Joey:</b> How do you get a monkey into a zoo?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> I know that one! ...No, that's Popes into a <em>Volkswagen</em>.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> Well, we're applying to a lot of them. Naturally our first choice would be one of the bigger state zoos, y'know, like, uh, San Diego... right? But that might just be a pipe dream, because, y'know, he's out of state. Uh, my vet, uh, knows someone at Miami, so that's a possibility.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, but that's like two blocks away from the beach. I mean, it's a total party zoo.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">(Phoebe, Monica, and Rachel enters.)</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Phoebe:</b> Hey. We found her, we found the girl.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> What?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Joey:</b> Did you call the cops?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> Nope. We took her to lunch.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> Ah. Your own brand of vigilante justice.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> What?! Are you insane? This woman stole from you. She stole. She's a stealer.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> Y'know what? After you're with this woman for like ten minutes, you forget all that. I mean, she is this astounding person, with this, with this amazing spirit.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, which she probably stole from some cheerleader.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> ...Take off their hats!</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Phoebe:</b> Popes in a <em>Volkswagen</em>! ...I love that joke.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Monica, Rachel and Fake Monica are there.]</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> No way. No way did you do this.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Fake Monica:</b> Monana was very brave.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> It was so wild. We told them we were the Gunnersens in room six fifteen. Only to find out the Boston Celtics had taken over the entire sixth floor!</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Fake Monica:</b> So once they caught on to the fact that we're, y'know, short and have breasts...</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> ...They threw us out! I was thrown out of a hotel! Me!</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> Go Monana! Well, you ladies are not the only ones living the dream. I get to go pour coffee for people I don't know. Don't wait up. (Exits)</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Fake Monica:</b> Oh, by the way, tomorrow we're auditioning for a Broadway show.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> 'Scuse me?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Fake Monica:</b> There's an open call for Cats. I'm thinking we go down there, sing Memories and make complete fools of ourselves. Whaddya say?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> Nononononono. Think who you're dealing with here. I mean, I'm not like you. I-I can't even stand in front of a tap class.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Fake Monica:</b> Well, that's just probably 'cause of your Amish background.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> What?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Fake Monica:</b> Well, you're Pennsylvania Dutch, right?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> Right. Till I bought a blow dryer, then I was shunned.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Fake Monica:</b> I-I used to be just like you. And then one day I saw a movie that changed my life. Did you ever see <em>Dead Poets' Society</em>?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> Uh-huh.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Fake Monica:</b> I thought that movie was so incredibly... <strong>boring</strong>. I mean, that thing at the end where the kid kills himself because he can't be in the play? What was that?! It's like, kid, wait a year, leave home, do some community theatre. I walked out of there and I thought, 'Now, that's two hours of my life that I'm never getting back.' And that thought scared me more than all the other crap I was afraid to do.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> Wow. Then I would definitely not recommend <em>Mrs. Doubtfire</em>.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, tiem lapse.&nbsp; Everyone but Joey and Monica are there.]</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> (Reading letters) Oh God. (To Marcel) We didn't get into Scranton. (To the others) That was like our safety zoo. They take like dogs and cows. See? I don't know who this is harder on, me or him.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Phoebe:</b> I'd say that chair's taking the brunt.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> Marcel! Marcel! Marcel, no! Good boy. See, how can nobody want him?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, somebody will.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> You're kidding.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Joey:</b> Apparently he was this Russian dictator who slaughtered all these people. You'd think you would've known that!</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> Y'know, you'd think I would've. Hey, how about Joey Hamilton?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Joey:</b> Com'on, seriously, I told you I don't wanna go back to Joey. Phoebe. Whaddyou think a good stage name for me would be?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Dr. Baldhara:</b> Well, it's technically not a zoo per se, it's more of an interactive wildlife experience. Let me ask you some questions about, is it, uh, Marcel?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> Yes.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Dr. Baldhara:</b> Yes. Does he, uh, fight with other animals?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Fake Monica:</b> Monica, I started my day by peeing in front of twenty-five other women, and you're worried about who's gonna take you to the <em>Big Apple Circus</em>?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> Well, not... worried, y'know, just... wondering.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Fake Monica:</b> There's nothing to wonder about, Monica. You're gonna go back to being exactly who you were, because that's who you are.</font></p>

I'm really gonna miss you, and I'm never gonna forget about you. You've been more than just a- pet to me, you've been more like a be- (Marcel climbs down and starts humping his leg) Okay, Marcel, please, could you leave my leg alone?
