<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh-ho, here's little Ben falling asleep.. A little bit later. Is he gonna sleep? Is he gonna sleep? Is he gonna.. Yep, out like a light!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Boy this sure trumps the "Has he pooped?" series.

<p><b>Joey:</b> Really, look, Ross, we love him, OK? But right now he's just a little naked fat guy. How excited can we get?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Guys:</b> Hi!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What you got there?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> 400 pictures of Ben on a rug.</p>

<p><b>Girls:</b> Oh, my god! Let me see! Oh..</p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> And here's little Ben nodding off...</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> Awww, look at Aunt Monica's little boy!</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, look, he's got Ross's haircut!</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, let me see! (grabs picture) Oh, God, is he just the sweetest thing? You must just want to kiss him all over!</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> Pardon?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> Nothing, just a little extra air in my mouth. Pffft. Pffffffft. (walks over to where Joey is seated)</font></p>

<p><font size="3">(Joey is looking at his check.)</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Joey:</b> Hey, Chan, can you help me out here? I promise I'll pay you back.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, yeah, right, OK... inlcuding the waffles last week, you now owe me... 17 jillion dollars.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Joey:</b> I will, really. I'll pay you back this time.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> (sigh)... And where's this money coming from? (gives money to Joey)</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Joey:</b> Well... I'm helping out down at the N.Y.U. Med School with some... research.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> (overhearing) What kind of research?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Joey:</b> Oh, just, y'know.... science.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> Science. Yeah, I think I've heard of that. (everyone's interest is piqued, they all look over)</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Joey:</b> (sigh)... It's a fertility study.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> Oh, Joey, please tell me you're only donating your <b>time</b>.</font></p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Actually a little bit more than that.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Thank you, God, this will bring us so much joy!</p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Joey:</b> Alright, come on you guys, it's not that big a deal. Really... I mean, I just go down there every other day and... make my contribution to the project. Hey, hey, but at the end of two weeks, I get seven hundred dollars.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> Hey.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Phoebe:</b> Wow, ooh, you're gonna be making money hand over fist!</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Joey:</b> I don't know, she's, uh.... she's pretty great.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> Yeah? What does she think of your little science project?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Joey:</b> What, you think I'm gonna tell a girl I like that I'm also seeing a cup?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Joey:</b> Well, the tough thing is, she <b>really</b> wants to have sex with me.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> Crazy bitch.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, well, I still got a week left to go in the program, and according to the rules, if I want to get the money I'm not allowed to conduct any... personal experiments, if you know what I mean.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> You're going to China?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, i-it's for the museum. Someone found a bone, we want the bone, but they don't want us to have the bone, so I'm going over there to try to persuade them to give us the bo&#8212;it's&#8212;it's a whole big bone thing. Anyway, I'm gonna be gone for like, uh... like a week, so, uh, if you wanna reach me, y-you can't. So here's my itinerary (hands a sheet of paper to Monica). Um... here's a picture of me... (hands it to Monica)</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, let me see! (takes the picture)</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> (to Monica): Could you take it to Carol's every now and then, and show it to Ben, just so he doesn't forget me?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Melanie:</b> Anyway, that's when me and my friends started this whole fruit basket business. We call ourselves 'The Three Basketeers.'</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Joey:</b> Like the three musketeers, only with fruit.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> (sarcastic) Ooooh. (looks dumbfounded at Joey's stupidity)</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> (gets up) OK, how does everybody like their burgers?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, no, no, no. Presents first. Food later. (walks into living room)</font></p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I don't care what Rachel says, we're doing presents first.</p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> Well, thank you, Melanie.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> (pointing out a gift) OK, this one right here is from me.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> (picks it up) OK... ah, it's light... (shakes it)...it rattles... it's... (opens it) <i>Travel Scrabble</i>! Oooohhh, thank you! (she gives it back to him)</font></p>

<p><font size="3">(Chandler looks dejected. Rachel picks up another gift.)</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> This one's from Joey... feels like a book. Thinks it's a book... feels like a book. And...(opens it)...it's a book!</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, it's Dr. Seuss!</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Joey:</b> (to Rachel): That book got me through some tough times.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Melanie:</b> There is a little child inside this man!</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> Yes, the doctors say if they remove it, he'll die.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">(Rachel picks up the next gift.)</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> Who's this from?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, that's Ross's. </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> Oh... (opens it)... (sees it is a pin) Oh my God. He remembered.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Phoebe:</b> Remembered what?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> It was like months ago. We were walking by this antique store, and I saw this pin in the window, and I told him it was just like one my grandmother had when I was a little girl. Oh! I can't believe he remembered!</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> Well, sure, but can you play it on a plane? (pats his <i>Travel Scrabble</i> game)</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, it's so pretty. This must have cost him a fortune.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> I can't believe he did this.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> Come on, Ross? Remember back in college, when he fell in love with Carol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck?</font></p>

<p><font size="3">(Everyone looks at him. He realizes he just spilled the beans about Ross's crush on Rachel. You can hear this entire classic scene by clicking here.)</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> What did you just say?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> (panicked) ahem... um... Crystal duck.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> No, no, no.... the, um, the... 'love' part?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> (stuttering incoherently) F-hah.... flennin....</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> Oh.... my God.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> (rubbing his temples) Oh, no-no-no-no-no....</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Phoebe:</b> I know. This is really, really huge.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> No it's not. It's small. It's tiny. It's petite. It's wee.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Phoebe:</b> Nuh-uh. I don't think any of our lives are ever gonna be the same ever again.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> I think this is so great! I mean, you and Ross! D-did you have any idea?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> No! None! I mean, my first night in the city, he mentioned something about asking me out, but nothing ever happened, so I just... (to Joey): W-well, what else did he say? I mean, does he, like, want to go out with me?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Joey:</b> Well, given that he's desperately in love with you, he probably wouldn't mind getting a cup of coffee or something.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> Ross? All this time? Well, I've got to talk to him. (gets up to leave)</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> Yeah, but if it's good news, you should tell him now.</font></p>
