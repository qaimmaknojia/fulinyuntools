<p><font size="3"><b>Joey:</b> No way! Mr.Salty is a sailor, all right, he's got to be, like, thetoughest snack there is.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> I don't know, you don't wanna mess with corn nuts. They're craaazy.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> (looking out of the window) Oh my God. You guys! You gotta come see this! There's some creep out there with a telescope!</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> I can't believe it! He's looking right at us!</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, that is so sick.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> I feel violated. And not in a good way.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Phoebe:</b> How can people do that?... (All but Phoebe walk away from the window in disgust.) Oh, you guys, look! Ugly Naked Guy got gravity boots!</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> I am telling you, years from now, schoolchildren will study it as one of the greatest first dates of all time. It was unbelievable! We could totally be ourselves, we didn't have to play any games...</font></p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I'll say yeah. We could totally be ourselves. We didn't have to play any games...</p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> So have you called her yet?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> Let her know I like her? What are you, insane? (The girls make disgusted noises.) It's the next day! How needy do I want to seem? (To the guys) I'm right, right?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Joey and Ross:</b> Oh, yeah. Yeah. Let her dangle.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> Oh, I can't believe my parents are actually pressuring me to find one of you people.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, God, come on, just do it! (Grabbing the phone.) Call her! Stop being so testosteroney!</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> Which, by the way, is the real San Francisco treat. (Calls her, then hurriedly hangs up.) I got her machine.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Joey:</b> Her answer machine?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> No, interestingly enough her leaf blower picked up.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Phoebe:</b> So, uh, why didn't you say anything?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, no-no-no-no. Last time I left a spontaneous message I ended up using the phrase "Yes indeedy-o."</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> Look look! It's Rachel and Barry. No, don't everybody look at once!</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> Okay, okay, what's going on?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay, they're just talking...</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, well, does he look upset? Does he look like he was just told to shove anything?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Phoebe:</b> No, no actually, he's smiling.. and... Oh my God, don't do that!!</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> What? What? What?!</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Phoebe:</b> That man across the street just kicked that pigeon! (Rachel enters.) Oh!</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> (bluffing) And basically, that's how a bill becomes a law.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>All:</b> Oh!... Right!</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> Hey Rach!</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> How'd it go?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> Y'know, it was, uh.. it was actually really great. He took me to lunch at the <em>Russian Tea Room</em>, and I had that chicken, where y'know you poke it and all the butter squirts out...</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Phoebe:</b> Not a good day for birds...</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> Then we took a walk down to <em>Bendall's</em>, and I told him not to, but he got me a little bottle of <em>Chanel</em>...</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> That's nice... now, was that before or after you told him to stop calling, stop sending you flowers and to generally leave you alone, hmm?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> Right,.. well,.. we never actually got to that... Oh, it was just so nice to see him again, y'know? It was comfortable, it was familiar... it was just nice!</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> That's, that's nice twice!</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> Rachel, what's going on? I mean isn't this the same Barry who you left at the altar?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Joey:</b> Duh, where've you been?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, but it was different with him today! And he wasn't, like, Orthodontist Guy, y'know? I mean, we had fun! Is there anything wrong with that?</font></p>

<p><font size="3">(Ross 'prompts' Chandler by hitting him on the arm.)</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> Yes!</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> Why?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> I have my reasons.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> Okay, how about the fact that he's engaged to another woman, who just happens to be your ex-best friend?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> All right. All right, all right, all right, all right, I know it's stupid! I will go see him this afternoon, and I will just put an end to it!</font></p>

<p><font size="3">[Scene: Barry's Office, the post-coital Barry and Rachel are recovering on the chair.]</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> Wow... Wow!</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Barry:</b> Yeah.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> I'm not crazy, right? I mean, it was never like that.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Barry:</b> Nooo, it wasn't.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> Ooh, and it's so nice having this little sink here...</font></p>

<p><font size="3">[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, everyone is there except Rachel.]</font></p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Then... with authority, hang up.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Will you just leave her the message already?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Ok, alright, fine. (on phone, reading from a script) Oh, Danielle! I wasn't expecting the machine... Give me a call when you get a chance. (Rattles some dishes) Bye-bye. (Hangs up.) Oh God!</p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> <strong>That's</strong> what you've been working on for the past two hours?!</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> Hey, I've been honing!</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> What was with the dishes?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, uh.. I want her to think I might be in a restaurant.. y'know? I might have some kind of life, like I haven't been sitting around here honing for the past few hours.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> (looking out the window) Look look! He's doing it again, the guy with the telescope!</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh my God! (Walks to the window) Go away! (Gesturing.) Stop looking in here!</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> Great, now he's waving back.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Joey:</b> Man, we gotta do something about that guy. This morning, I caught him looking into our apartment. It creeps me out! I feel like I can't do stuff!</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> What kinda stuff?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Joey:</b> Will you grow up? I'm not talking about sexy stuff, but, like, when I'm cooking naked.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Phoebe:</b> You cook naked?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, toast, oatmeal... nothing that spatters.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">(A pause as they look at Chandler.)</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> What are you looking at me for? I didn't know that.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">[Scene: Barry's Office, Rachel and Barry are getting dressed.]</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Barry:</b> What's the matter?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, it's just... Oh, Barry, this was not good.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Barry:</b> No, it was. It was very very good.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> Well, what about Mindy?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Barry:</b> Oh, way, way better than Mindy.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> No, not that, I mean, what about you and Mindy?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Barry:</b> Well, if you want, I'll just&#8212;I'll just break it off with her.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> No. No-no-no-no, no. I mean, don't do that. Not, I mean not for me. </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Bernice:</b> (over intercom) Dr. Farber, Bobby Rush is here for his adjustment.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Barry:</b> (into intercom) Thanks, Bernice. (To Rachel) Let's go away this weekend.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, Barry..! Come on, this is all way too..</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Barry:</b> We can, we can go to Aruba! When I went there on what would have been our honeymoon, it was, uh... it was really nice. You would've liked it.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">(Pause as Rachel realises...)</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> I had a bra.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">(Barry finds it draped on a cupboard and gives it to Rachel, they kiss as Bobby enters.)</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Bobby:</b> Hey, Dr. Farber.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">(Rachel and Barry quickly split and pretend Barry is examining Rachel's mouth.)</font></p>

<p><font size="3">(Bobby looks on, deadpan.)</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Bobby:</b> I'm twelve, I'm not stupid.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> Yeah.. uh, but for future reference, that thing in your hand can also be used as a phone.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">(Chandler dials his own phone and it rings.)</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> Yes, it's working! Why isn't she calling me back?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Joey:</b> Maybe she never got your message.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Phoebe:</b> Y'know, if you want, you can call her machine, and if she has a lot of beeps, that means she probably didn't get her messages yet.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> Y'don't think that makes me seem a little...</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> ...desperate, needy, pathetic?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> Ah, you obviously saw my personal ad.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">(He calls and quickly hangs up.)</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Phoebe:</b> How many beeps?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> She answered.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> Y'see, this is where you'd use that 'hello' word we talked about.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> I'm not gonna talk to her, she obviously got my message and is choosing not to call me. Now I'm needy and snubbed. God, I miss just being needy.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> Pretty well, actually... (Wandering into the kitchen.)</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> (wandering in after her) Uh, Rach... how come you have dental floss in your hair?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, do I?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> Uh huh.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Rachel:</b> (in a low voice) We ended up having sex in his chair.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> If it helps, I could slide over.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> It's, it's, it's, uh, a totally diferent situation! It's, it's apples and oranges, it's, it's orthodontists and lesbi- I gotta go.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Phoebe:</b> Where are you going?</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> (leaving) I just have to go, all right? Do I need a reason? Huh? I mean I have things to do with my life, I have a jam packed schedule, and I am late- for keeping up with it. Okay?</font></p>

<p><font size="3">(Ross exits, a phone rings, and Chandler dives for his phone.)</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> Hello? Hello?</font></p>

<p><font size="3">(Rachel picks up their phone and the ringing stops.&nbsp; As she talks on the phone, an elaborate visual gag is spun out which is too difficult to describe in words.)</font></p>
