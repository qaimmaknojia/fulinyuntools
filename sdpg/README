Prerequisites:
libxml2
ferret
gnu c++ compiler (g++)
flex 4 sdk
apache2 httpd server, you need to set "/home/$USER/public_html" as your httpd root directory, and you need to have "/home/$USER/public_html/sdpg" directory created
firefox web browser with flash player plugin

Compile preprocess:
g++ -opreprocess preprocess.cpp -lxml2 -lm

Run the generator:
./doall.sh http://www.ferret.noaa.gov/thredds/dodsC/data/PMEL/coads_climatology.nc

Known issues:
if header.xml generated by ferret contains illegal characters, manual execution of the rest of commands in doall.sh (from "./preprocess header.xml") is needed after manually clean the illegal characters.
