\section*{Chapter 10, Problem 2}
The difficulty in 3-SAT comes from the fact that there are $2^n$ possible
assignments to the input variables $x_l, x_2, \dots, x_n$, and there's no apparent
way to search this space in polynomial time. This intuitive picture, however,
might create the misleading impression that the fastest algorithms
for 3-SAT actually require time $2^n$. In fact, though it's somewhat counter-intuitive
when you first hear it, there are algorithms for 3-SAT that run
in significantly less than $2^n$ time in the worst case; in other words, they determine whether there's a satisfying assignment in less time than it
would take to enumerate all possible settings of the variables.

Here we'll develop one such algorithm, which solves instances of 3-SAT in $O(p(n)\cdot(\sqrt{3})^n)$ time for some polynomial $p(n)$. Note that the main
term in this running time is $(\sqrt{3})^n$, which is bounded by $1.74^n$.
\begin{itemize}
\item[(a)] For a truth assignment $\Phi$ for the variables $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n$, we use $\Phi(x_i)$
to denote the value assigned by $\Phi$ to $x_i$. (This can be either 0 or
1.) If $\Phi$ and $\Phi'$ are each truth assignments, we define the distance
between $\Phi$ and $\Phi'$ to be the number of variables $x_i$ for which they
assign different values, and we denote this distance by $d(\Phi, \Phi')$. In
other words, $d(\Phi, \Phi') = \left|\left\{i : \Phi(x_i) \ne \Phi'(x_i)\right\}\right|$.

A basic building block for our algorithm will be the ability to
answer the following kind of question: Given a truth assignment $\Phi$
and a distance $d$, we'd like to know whether there exists a satisfying
assignment $\Phi'$ such that the distance from $\Phi$ to $\Phi'$ is at most $d$.
Consider the following algorithm, {\tt Explore}($\Phi, d$), that attempts to
answer this question.
\vspace{-2ex}
\begin{table}[h!]
\texttt{
\begin{tabular}{l}
\hline
Explore($\Phi, d$)\\
\hspace{2em}If $\Phi$ is a satisfying assignment then return ``yes''\\
\hspace{2em}Else if $d = 0$ then return ``no''\\
\hspace{2em}Else\\
\hspace{4em}Let $C_i$ be a clause that is not satisfied by $\Phi$\\
\hspace{6em}(i.e., all three terms in $C_i$ evaluate to false)\\
\hspace{4em}Let $\Phi_1$ denote the assignment obtained from $\Phi$ by\\
\hspace{6em}taking the variable that occurs in the first term of\\
\hspace{6em}clause $C_i$ and inverting its assigned value\\
\hspace{4em}Define $\Phi_2$ and $\Phi_3$ analogously in terms of the\\
\hspace{6em}second and third terms of the clause $C_i$\\
\hspace{4em}Recursively invoke:\\
\hspace{6em}Explore($\Phi_1, d-1$)\\
\hspace{6em}Explore($\Phi_2, d-1$)\\
\hspace{6em}Explore($\Phi_3, d-1$)\\
\hspace{4em}If any of these three calls returns ``yes''\\
\hspace{6em}then return ``yes''\\
\hspace{4em}Else return ``no''\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
}
\end{table}

Prove that {\tt Explore}($\Phi, d$) returns ``yes'' if and only if there exists
a satisfying assignment $\Phi'$ such that the distance from $\Phi$ to $\Phi'$ is at
most $d$. Also, give an analysis of the running time of {\tt Explore}($\Phi, d$)
as a function of $n$ and $d$.

\item[(b)] Clearly any two assignments $\Phi$ and $\Phi'$ have distance at most $n$
from each other, so one way to solve the given instance of 3-SAT
would be to pick an arbitrary starting assignment $\Phi$ and then run
{\tt Explore}($\Phi, n$). However, this will not give us the running time we
want.

Instead, we will need to make several calls to Explore, from
different starting points $\Phi$, and search each time out to more limited
distances. Describe how to do this in such a way that you can solve
the instance of 3-SAT in a running time of only $O(p(n)\cdot(\sqrt{3})^n)$.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Answer}
\subsection*{Answer to subproblem (a)}
We use mathematical induction on $d$.

For $d = 0$, if {\tt Explore}($\Phi, 0$) returns ``yes'' then $\Phi$ must be a satisfying assignment, and vice versa. Since $\Phi$ is an assignment with distance 0 from itself, the result holds for $d=0$.

Suppose the result holds for $d = k\ge 0$, i.e., {\tt Explore}($\Phi, k$) returns ``yes'' if and only if there exists
a satisfying assignment $\Phi'$ such that the distance from $\Phi$ to $\Phi'$ is at
most $k$. When $d=k+1$, {\tt Explore}($\Phi, k+1$) returns ``yes'' if and only if $\Phi$ is a satisfying assignment, or any of {\tt Explore}($\Phi_1, k$), {\tt Explore}($\Phi_2, k$) and {\tt Explore}($\Phi_3, k$) returns ``yes'', which is equivalent to say there exists a satisfying assignment of distance 0 from $\Phi$ or within distance $k$ from $\Phi_1$, $\Phi_2$ or $\Phi_3$, which is equivalent to say there exists a satisfying assignment within distance $k+1$ from $\Phi$. So the results holds for $d=k+1$.

The running time for {\tt Explore}($\Phi, d$), denoted as $T(n, d)$, includes the time spent on checking whether $\Phi$ is a satisfying assignment ($O(p(n))$), and the time spent on recursively calling {\tt Explore}($\Phi_1, d-1$), {\tt Explore}($\Phi_2, d-1$) and {\tt Explore}($\Phi_3, d-1$), which contains only $n-1$ variables to assign each. So we have the following equation.
\begin{align}
T(n,d) = O(p(n)+3T(n-1, d-1))
\end{align}
Since $d\le n$, we have
\begin{align}
\nonumber T(n,d) & = O(p(n)+3p(n-1)+\dots+3^{d-1}p(n-d)+3^dT(n-d, 0))\\
& =O(p(n)\cdot3^d)
\end{align}

\subsection*{Answer to subproblem (b)}
Let $\Phi_0$ be the assignment where all the variables from $\{x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n\}$ are assigned with 0, and $\Phi_1$ the assignment where all the variables are assigned 1. Then there exists a satisfying assignment if and only if any one of {\tt Explore}($\Phi_0,\lceil n/2 \rceil$) and {\tt Explore}($\Phi_1,\lceil n/2 \rceil$) returns ``yes''. Because any assignment must be within distance $\lceil n/2 \rceil$ from either $\Phi_0$ or $\Phi_1$.

This gives us the running time of $O(3^{\lceil n/2\rceil}p(n))$ = $O(p(n)\cdot(\sqrt{3})^n)$.

\section*{Chapter 11, Problem 10}
Suppose you are given an $n \times n$ {\em grid graph} $G$, as in Figure~1.
\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{11.10.eps}
\caption{A grid graph}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

Associated with each node $v$ is a {\em weight} $w(v)$, which is a nonnegative
integer. You may assume that the weights of all nodes are distinct. Your goal is to choose an independent set $S$ of nodes of the grid, so that the
sum of the weights of the nodes in $S$ is as large as possible. (The sum of
the weights of the nodes in $S$ will be called its {\em total weight}.)

Consider the following greedy algorithm for this problem.
\begin{table}[h!]
\texttt{
\begin{tabular}{l}
\hline
The ``heaviest-first'' greedy algorithm:\\
\hspace{2em}Start with $S$ equal to the empty set\\
\hspace{2em}While some node remains in $G$\\
\hspace{4em}Pick a node $v_i$ of maximum weight\\
\hspace{4em}Add $v_i$ to $S$\\
\hspace{4em}Delete $v_i$ and its neighbors from $G$\\
\hspace{2em}Endwhile\\
\hspace{2em}Return $S$\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
}
\end{table}
\begin{itemize}
\item[(a)] Let $S$ be the independent set returned by the ``heaviest-first'' greedy
algorithm, and let $T$ be any other independent set in $G$. Show that, for
each node $v \in T$, either $v \in S$, or there is a node $v'\in S$ so that $w(v) \le w(v')$
and $(v, v')$ is an edge of $G$.
\item[(b)] Show that the ``heaviest-first'' greedy algorithm returns an independent
set of total weight at least 1/4 times the maximum total weight of
any independent set in the grid graph $G$.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Answer}
\subsection*{Answer to subproblem (a)}
We prove by contradiction. Suppose there exists $v\in T$ such that $v\notin S$ and $v$ has no neighbor $v' \in S$ such that $w(v) \le w(v')$. Then we know that at least one of $v$'s neighbors must be in $S$, since at least one of $v$ and its adjacent nodes must be in $S$. Suppose $v'\in S$ is $v$'s neighbor, then at the time $v'$ is added to $S$, $v$ must still remains, because $v$ has no neighbor with a greater weight and $v\notin S$, but according to the algorithm, $v'$ cannot be added to $S$ at this time, because it is not the heaviest weight remaining node ($w(v)>w(v')$). This is a contradiction. So for
each node $v \in T$, either $v \in S$, or there is a node $v'\in S$ so that $w(v) \le w(v')$
and $(v, v')$ is an edge of $G$.

\subsection*{Answer to subproblem (b)}
We know that any node $v$ in $G$ has at most 4 neighbors. So for any independent set $T$, up to 4 nodes from $T-S$ can share one node from $S-T$ as their common neighbor, according to the result proven in subproblem (a), we have
\begin{align}
\nonumber\sum_{v\in T}w(v) & =\sum_{v\in T\cap S}w(v)+\sum_{v\in T-S}w(v)\\
& \le \sum_{v'\in S\cap T}w(v')+4\sum_{v'\in S-T}w(v')\le 4\sum_{v'\in S}w(v')
\end{align}
Therefore the ``heaviest-first'' greedy algorithm returns an independent
set of total weight at least 1/4 times the maximum total weight of
any independent set in the grid graph $G$.
